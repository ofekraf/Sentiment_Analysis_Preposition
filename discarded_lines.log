Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.
" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  
Predictable, but not a bad watch.  
sorry but angry with a ceain espn show right now.
i'm not saying all that but okay
does that have any substantive argument? trumpsters have mental problems and therefore ...
 I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
 But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
 However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
 I am afraid not.  Therefore -
 But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
 But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
 But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
 But I-- .
 Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
 But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
 At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
 Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
 But what is it they don't like?
 But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
 But this is absurd!
 But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
 Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
 But what about the past? Our past?
 But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
 I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
 But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
 But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
 Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
 But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
 Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
 This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
 But in your profession that is a risk.
 But you found another choice.
 But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
 But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
 But chickens?
 Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
 But did you know him?
 But you don't look very happy.
 But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
 Therefore, I shall ignore you.
 But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
 And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
 But it IS! Look!
 But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
 Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
 But I think I am. I like to think I am.
