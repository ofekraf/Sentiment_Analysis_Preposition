 But you hate Joey
 But she doesn't want to date.
 But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
 Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
 But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
 But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
 But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
 No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
 But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
 But -- who -- what --?
 But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
 But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
 But it's...
 But Chief?  Over this??
 How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
 But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
 But what if it does?  You might need my help.
 Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
 No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
 He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
 But you knew that, right?
 But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
 But not completely inconceivable?
 But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
 But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
 But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
 But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
 I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
 But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
 This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
 First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
 There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
 But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
 But how...?
 But Dad --
 But how are we gonna --
 But I've seen her grave.
 But if they <u>do</u>?
 However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
 But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
 But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
 But - what can we accomplish?
 But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
 But it's not funny now.
 But not now.
 But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
 But they start executing hostages in
 But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
 But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
 But this is different, sir. You're the President.
 Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
 But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
 But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
 But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
 But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
 But Ted, you're the only...
 But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
 But if you'll just give me...
 But there's no more drug.
 But I-- .
 But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
 But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
 But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
 But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
 At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
 I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
 Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
 But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
 In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
 Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
 But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
 But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
 But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
 But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
 But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
 But what is it they don't like?
 But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
 But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
 But this is absurd!
 But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
 But, Your Majesty -
 But not his body.
 But he's all right?
 But, David.
 But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
 But listen, Tom, I�
 But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
 But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
 But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
 But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
 But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
 But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
 But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
 But I haven't . . .
 But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
 But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
 But if we take their money and supplies...
 But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
 Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
 But he killed a lot of men, too.
 But still died.
 But you got big!
 But I like the presidential suite.
 But where?
 But what about the past? Our past?
 But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
 But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
 But I think...I want to know what happened here.
 But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
 But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
 But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
 Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
 Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
 But Marcus denied it?
 But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
 I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
 But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
 Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
 But you said the other --
 I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
 But they'd still get the idea, right?
 But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
 But why would they --?
 But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
 But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
 Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
 I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
 But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
 But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
 But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
 But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
 One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
 But -- why?
 But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
 But --
 But you did suspect me.
 But if someone miniaturized the process...
 But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
 But why? What's the point?
 But did they teach you this?
 But how can I do that?
 But a fabulous cook.
 But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
 But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
 But he killed these guys.
 But the right guess on this is arson.
 Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
 Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
 But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
 Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
 But the line has to be drawn.
 I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
 But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
 But how, sir?
 But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
 But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
 Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
 But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
 But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
 But, for a time... a passing fancy?
 But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
 But you refused me, Dorothy.
 But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
 But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
 Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
 But not Pike's.
 But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
 But you didn't.
 But not the only victim, right?
 But you will.
 But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
 Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
 But you didn't see it, right?
 But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
 I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
 Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
 Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
 Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
 You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
 But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
 But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
 I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
 But it's not true.
 But it's romantic.
 But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
 But, you know, so what?
 This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
 But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
 Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
 But not to last.
 Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
 Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
 But I would like to buy you drink.
 But if you could?
 But you haven't put in for emigration.
 But then how can you...
 But if I don't plug it in how can I...
 But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
 But in your profession that is a risk.
 But I understand what you mean.
 But how come I'd be there?
 But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
 But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
 But, Eve, I would--
 Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
 But, I don't understand.
 But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
 I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
 But first, you have to start with the clothes!
 I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
 I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
 But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
 But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
 It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
 But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
 But he didn't say anything.
 But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
 But you're thieves. It's what you are.
 But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
 But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
 I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
 But you found another choice.
 But you're sure?
 But we were so careful.
 But it ends up the same.
 But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
 But if we have not caught Wallace --
 But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
 You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
 But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
 But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
 But you must have something to go on?
 But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
 But I... I need those books.
 But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
 Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
 But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
 But Sacha always puts out that light --
 And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
 But what about us?
 But Richard, no, I, I --
 But why my name, Richard?
 But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
 But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
 But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
 But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
 But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
 But we made a deal.
 Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
 But I have no excuse to close it.
 But everybody's having such a good time.
 But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
 You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
 But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
 But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
 But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
 But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
 But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
 But chickens?
 Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
 But I might not have.
 But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
 But you had so much *responsibility*.
 But you looked as if you liked it.
 But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
 But did you know him?
 But she's your *daughter*...
 But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
 But you don't look very happy.
 But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
 But there were other factors.
 But you won't get that splatter effect.
 But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
 But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
 But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
 You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
 Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
 But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
 But if it does.
 But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
 But how do you know you exist?
 Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
 They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
 But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
 But the boss knows I always been loyal.
 But I'm afraid of--
 But why can't we stay here?
 Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
 But she does work here?
 But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
 But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
 But there's another side--
 But I'll take a rain check...
 But, mom!
 But we took the keys?
 But you're OK?
 I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
 But you were punished.
 But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
 But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
 But now you can't go.
 But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
 Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
 But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
 But you're my father -
 But -
 But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
 But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
 But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
 But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
 I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.
 But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
 But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
 But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
 But, Father, it IS!
 But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
 But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
 But you don't realize....
 But, Erik...
 But you LOVED her all the same...
 But surely you know...?
 But --
 But have you ever seen it? Think back...
 But it IS! Look!
 But you don't want to hear it.
 But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
 But you're the Gods!
 But how could he know... unless...
 But HOW?
 But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
 But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
 But it's a responsibility...
 But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
 But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
 Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
 But my sleeping is really fucked up.
 But you weren't. I could tell.
 But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
 Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
 But I think I am. I like to think I am.
 But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
 On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
 The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
 But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
 But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
 But I don't know how to polka.
 But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
 I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
