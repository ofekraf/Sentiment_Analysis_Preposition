" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  
sentlel no offence but i find my self very bored on sunday afternoons i used to look forward to this day but now ay  for days
 But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
 But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
 But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
 However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
 But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
 I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
 But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
 But he's all right?
 But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
 But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
 But still died.
 But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
 But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
 But -- why?
 But if someone miniaturized the process...
 But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
 But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
 But the right guess on this is arson.
 But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
 But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
 But not Pike's.
 Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
 Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
 But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
 But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
 But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
 But it ends up the same.
 But you must have something to go on?
 Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
 But why my name, Richard?
 But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
 You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
 But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
 But how do you know you exist?
 They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
 But you're my father -
 But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
 But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
