# Sentiment_Analysis_Preposition
This project aims to use Sentiment analysis tools to gain perspective on the meaning og prepositions in the English language. 

## Sentiment Analysis Models used
To date (05/11/20) three (pre-trained) sentiment analysis models have been used:
-	Textblob
-	nltk_vader
-	stanza
##  Raw text sentences origin
To date (05/11/20) the sentences in the text have come from amazon, IMDB, yelp reviews, as well as tweets, and movie scripts. Below you can find links to the github repositories that this data was taken from:
-	https://github.com/microsoft/ML-Server-PythonSamples/tree/master/microsoftml/202/data/sentiment_analysis 
-	http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html 
-	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sharmaroshan/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/master/test_tweets.csv 
-	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sharmaroshan/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/master/train_tweet.csv 
from the tweets dataset, I only took tweets that followed these two criteria: 
1	.the tweet did not contain '#' or '@'
2.	The tweet contained only utf8 characters (mainly, no emojis)
