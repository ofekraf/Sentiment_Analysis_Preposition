the camera,###---###rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.
i contacted the company and they told me that,###---###the unit was still under warranty, if i couldn't produce my receipt i was out of luck.
i think it was robert ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father)###---###he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  
as a european, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities,###---###the circumstances were slightly different.  
highly recommended for all ages,###---###the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  
she was quite disappointed###---###some blame needs to be placed at her door.
