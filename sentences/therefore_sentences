when someone says they love you,  every effo gets noticed###---###should be exploited! im afraid of what im seeing. i love my girl.
 i'm sorry, dave, but in accordance with sub-routine c1532/4, quote, when the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. i must,###---### override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.

 gentlemen, i have a plan. it's called blackmail. the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like prince charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and,###---### they would have to divorce.
