i went on motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.
this is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.
buy a different phone - but not this.
this item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.
i've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but i really like it.
i know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.well, this one works great.
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway.
i usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once (thats when i first used it).
only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.
not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.
i have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when i am home, but you cant not hear anything.
it was an inexpensive piece, but i would still have expected better quality.
the microphone also works well, but (according to people i have called) it applifies everything.
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement
i have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best.
i might have gotten a defect, but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.
my colleague & i now get great reception.a little expensive, but performance is great.
perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when i use this.
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the fire red and it's a great color!
they do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.easy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried.
when i placed my treo into the case, not only was it not snug, but there was a lot of extra room on the sides.
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.
the handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the treo reboots.overall, i still rate this device high.
looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear.
can't store anything but phone numbers to sim.
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.the good
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great.
i have read other's reviews here but i haven't had any problem with it.
i have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.
my phone sounded ok ( not great - ok), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.
yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  
the performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  
it crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  
i especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, i could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  
if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  
i love lane, but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  
this is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  
crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  
garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work, but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  
one more thing: i can tolerate political incorrectness very well, i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the slavic female character was just too much.  
it features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute but if anyone has a question about fort steele, just ask away:)  
i think it was robert ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  
not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  
the use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  
i hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which i really like the star - but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell.  
i won't say any more - i don't like spoilers, so i don't want to be one, but i believe this film is worth your time.  
i wasn't expecting oscar material, but this?  
this is one i did not have, but i watched it recently on fox movie channel, and was very disappointed.  
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  
hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  
this movie was kind of long in length, but i enjoyed every minute of it.  
totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  
20th century fox's road house 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  
while you don't yet hear mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  
both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  
this was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  
in conclusion, i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense.  
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but george was well dull.  
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  
im big fan of rpg games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting rpger there is.  
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist doctor quinn.  
call me a nut, but i think this is one of the best movies ever.  
i won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  
the best scene in the movie is at the end, but i won't spoil it.  
at around 4 pm i bought it, at around 8pm i started to watch, at around 8.15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone.  
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad.  
the movie is not completely perfect but 'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  
i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  
they are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  
it's a sad movie, but very good.  
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
the ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.
i guess i should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the excalibur, but i didn't use my common sense.
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.
we thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.
restaurant is always full but never a wait.
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but i'm not inspired to go back.
not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.
love this place, hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.
the food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.
i had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of.
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.
i've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from jenni pho.
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers, but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place.
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.
of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.
i find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.
the dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.
to summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular.
we've tried to like this place but after 10+ times i think we're done with them.
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
i don't each much pasta, but i love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.
we got sitting fairly fast, but  ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had.
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
when i opened the sandwich, i was impressed, but not in a good way.
i don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.
i do love sushi, but i found kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job.
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
i started this review with two stars, but i'm editing it to give it only one.
i could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.
we aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
the building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but i wouldn't eat here again.
maybe it's just their vegetarian fare, but i've been twice and i thought it was average at best.
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.
i don't know what the big deal is about this place, but i won't be back "ya'all".
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.

 oh, i thought you might have a date  i don't know why i'm bothering to ask, but are you going to bogey lowenstein's party saturday night?
 it's just a party. daddy, but i knew you'd forbid me to go since "gloria steinem" over there isn't going --
 now don't get upset. daddy, but there's this boy... and i think he might ask...
 buttholus extremus.  but hey, you're making progress.
 unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  so what's the point?
 i could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  she's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  and that's an impossibility.
 yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  they just jack off to clint eastwood.
 i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but i'm consuming.  do you mind?
 i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  you're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
 yeah, but then i fucked up. i fell for her.
 you know, these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats, but they're right up there.
 naturally.  but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.

 i'd love to argue with you sometimes.  but you're never here!
 i am not a seaman.  but i heard it is no more than a week at sea.  i hope you are not too disappointed.

 forgive me, don colon.  but what about gold?
 diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... brothers should be raised together, colon.  even brothers from different mothers...
 i should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  but santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... and sanchez, that you are not a fool.
 well, i surely know what a quadrant is!  but i've never seen it used at night before.
 ... but there is worse.  he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
 every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  but with no gold! the new world proves expensive, your majesty.
 yes, but he was a cop.
 look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. tell us the truth...is that the truth?
 how are you going to fight this?  maybe if oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  you'd have the good to weight against the bad! it's unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing i can do!  gimme your shield.
 chief - i know i screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
 okay.  but not water sports.
 still unknown but we're running prints. kid over there caught the case.
 what's the kid gonna say - sorry? meanwhile i'm not here anymore. like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  who knows?  but some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and i'm thinkin' that's me. sooner or later.  that's me.
 yeah.  he wanted a girl from czechoslovakia, but i sent him honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - honey was killed...?  poor girl...
 we don't have her i.d. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel.
 you know, i don't know.  i like you. you remind me of a puppy i used to have. he pissed on the rug all the time, but i still kept him.
 no, i don't think you were a fool, i just think you were stupid about it.  i mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  you don't know her well enough. she's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  you can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. you're dead.
 the super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
 sure.  but i would like to ask you something.  you got a problem with me?
 hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  it gives us somethin' to do.
 okay.  that is great.  but i can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
 um...now is not a good time, okay. detective jackson's hurt.  he's fine. i've got a fire marshall shot, detective jackson is hurt but not seriously.
 he was hurt, but not seriously.  he'll be fine.
 okay.  but i do understand that your partner, leon jackson's been injured. is that correct?
 i understand, but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you.  is this somehow related to the fire department?
 look, man, i don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
 oh my g-d.  we were having lunch here. he started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but i got a call to anchor - and i walked out on him.  i walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
 yes, we're in new york now.  but where are you planning to stay in new york?
 it was my finger that pulled the trigger, but i'm not morally responsible.  my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of.  how could i know. i'm not a doctor.
 i'm sorry, dr. smyslov, but i'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
 i'm afraid i've only got a few minutes, but i'd love to.
 yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
 yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
 just ask hal. it's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from hal.
 yesterday, i finally called the accounting office at mission control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the ags-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
 that's right. well, naturally, i didn't say anything to payroll. i assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. but it's been almost three weeks now and i'm still being paid as an ags-18.
 well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
 i know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, dave, but it would be a crying shame, since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and i have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
 i'm sorry, dave, but in accordance with sub-routine c1532/4, quote, when the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. i must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
 i don't like to assert myself, dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. you've been involved in a very stressful situation.
 i suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
 naturally, dave, i'm not pleased that the ao-unit has failed, but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. i certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
 look, dave, i know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but i can assure the problem is with the ao-units, and with your test gear.
 i'm not questioning your word, dave, but it's just not possible. i'm not capable of being wrong.
 yes, i know that. but i can assure you that they were about to fail.
 the unit is still operational, dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
 sorry to interrupt the festivities, dave, but i think we've got a problem.
 i'm sorry, frank, but i don't think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
 he's fine. but i'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
 yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
 i'm sorry, but i'm not sure i know what you mean.
 i don't think it has, but i'd like to check that. simpson, what's the log on that?
 well, not really. at first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
 i know you did, frank, but i assure you there was an impending failure.
 hey, no, i'm tryin' to be nice. buy yourself something pretty. i'd do it, but i got to go.  i got this cop waitin' for me...
 no, i go to a school to learn how to do hair. it's a government program. but really i want to be a model - and i am definitely not sellin'.
 excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, i'm gonna bust.  you interested?
 no trouble, jack. but  listen, suppose i stay a crook?  where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
 hey, jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but i was fantastic.
 yeah.  but i wasn't there for a second.
 sure, i'll give you a shot at it, but ganz is mine.  you know, that big indian plays it for keeps...
 yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
 i don't know about you, but i could use a drink... i'll buy you one.  it'll be my good-bye present.
 i don't know why, but i'm going to let you keep it. maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because i'm too tired to argue...
 yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... but since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
 i can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  i got to be on the street.  get me outta here.
 i can deliver ganz.  but you gotta get me outta here first.
 okay.  you're not a team player. you gotta do things your own way. fine.  nail this guy and make us all look good.  but you better watch your ass.  if you screw up, i can promise you, you're goin' down.
 yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
 jack, it's all over the papers. he's an obvious type.  but this indian...
 i can see that.  pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  what happened?
 just one.  some lady called.  said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... but she still wants her occasional roommate. she'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
 i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. but just because i think it's bullshit doesn't mean i don't know something about it.
 yeah, i know that, but this is me and we're old friends. i haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
 no, i'm not proud of myself... but we don't have the luxury of choice.
 personally, they are of no interest to me, i'd rather sell weapons. but i have a customer... so tell me...
 yeah, i know... to save the world... but right now all i want to do is save leeloo.
 you're probably very angry with me and i quite understand. but i want you to know i'm fighting for a noble cause.
 father, i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends. so thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
 i'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston.
 there's not a moment to lose! wake her up, but be gentle about it!  this woman is mankind's most precious possession! she is... perfect!
 that's me.  but i don't know who she is... where did you find her?
 your theory is interesting father but i don't think we have time to go into it right now!
 uh father, i know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
 i'll help her, i promise, but i think you should tell me where the stones are!
 she was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
 finger..man..i'm sorry..listen..i was on the way over but i had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
 i love you too major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
 all i want is an explanation! i just got in, i lost my job. i smashed my cab. i got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, ma, thanks for asking!! now settle down and explain to me calmly..
 ...sorry, general, but we've got no choice! it'll only take a minute! let me set up another meeting and i'll be back.
 you're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
 you're nothing but a... a...
 yes! but "love" isn't the operative word here, peace is!
 you right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! grandfather say: "it never rain every day." this is good news guarantee.. i bet you lunch!
 i managed to contact the mondoshawan. they deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
 i can hear you, mr. president, but i can't see you .
 fine, just fine!  i'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  but it wasn't easy. my costs have tripled.
 you trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
 he might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
 it's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  i hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
 files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  we try to keep the children and adults separate. no eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
 few days ago, i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  that's the last they saw her.  the reason they came to me for help, the reason i'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  they want to see if i can i.d. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
 absolutely.  of course i'll abide by whatever decision you make, but i'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
 made me sick, but what did i care? what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  it was just something i was doing for money.
 well, whatever reasons mrs. christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, i should certainly be a party to. but  since she feels differently, i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
 "devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but i'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
 out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  he'll also do commissions, for enough money...
 i don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
 well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what i'm doing, but you can make some money.
 i don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, i'm straight.
 it's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
 well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
 i've got about five thousand left in cash, but i'll need another thirty, if you approve.
 of course.  but  i'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
 please, believe me.  this is probably a stag film.  simulated rape.  hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
 mrs. christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  i want you to listen carefully. what you're talking about is a "snuff film."  but  from what i know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  like, red light district folklore.  there's no such thing, i can assure you.
 i didn't know what to think.  i can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  to know that he watched this... this atrocity.  but  i can't go to the police...
 my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  i knew about it, but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business.  not till now, that is.
 we were married forty-five years. hard even for me to imagine.  we had our troubles.  there were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and i to him.  i loved him deeply.
 mostly.  that's where he started his empire building.  he was a good man.  notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  he wanted to be legendary.
 what am i supposed to do?  forget her?  time heals all wounds, right?  she's all i think about, and i've learned to live with that.  but  you want the truth... the real truth? if i had a choice... if i had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  i'd choose to know.
 i think about it everyday.  but  every time the phone rings... every single time, i still think it's her.
 you're probably right, and i probably won't find anything. i don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  police are just as human as you or i.  they could have missed something.  they probably didn't.  wouldn't you rather know?
 if the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
 it is possible... and i know this isn't something you want to hear. your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  she might have wanted to tell you something...
 it's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. see, i know a little about missing persons.  when kids run, they almost always leave a note.  it's guilt. they want to say goodbye.
 there wasn't anything like that. the police and the fbi people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  my husband... his heart broke when mary left...
 you have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
 if there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but i have to ask.  your husband... he committed suicide?
 he's an imbecile.  i tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
 you'll hear all kinds of stories. they'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
 cut that shit out.  maybe before, but not now. i want to help you. i'm on your side.
 no offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
 we know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
 look, i appreciate what you're offering, but no.  he is my responsibility.
 they're coach seats, but the plane lands in paris.  it's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
 i am your friend, and i'm worried sick about you.  but  you're like a locked safe.  you've gotta start dealing with reality.
 oh, alice...no.  honey, i love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
 i don't understand what's happening. krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to dan and greta while i was awake. how's he doing it?
 they're waiting for us.. but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
 it was no accident.  it was krueger.  he used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  he's found some other way.
 i'm very fucking sorry, but greta is dead today.  could we interest you in someone else?
 they're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  but now - i wonder -
 you may not <u>win</u> them.  but without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
 perhaps.  but the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - i'm referring to war - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
 that may be.  but dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and i'm staying here!
 <u>you</u> said it.  but i won't argue -
 it was moderate.  he'll be all right.  but it was out of the question, his coming along.
 how about that! the bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
 now, dave old buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  what do you think of this husband of yours?  on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer.  but unfortunately, in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself -
 sidearms?  but the saucer's dead.
 we're dead in the water.  but it indicates we're moving!
 we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  but suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
 it doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
 of course.  but it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
 yeah, sure. why? i got this damned tooth, i got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. but i'm okay.
 there's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new browning you was showing me last night. this must be twombley's gun. brand new. very fancy tooling. probably fired one time. it's a beautiful piece of work.  but what the hell, jack, i guess you deserve it. right's right.
 some job. here, have a hit. don't be such a hardass. i know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
 well, i guess i am. i planned this, i planned all this, you know. i mean, it's sort of pathetic, but i planned it. you shouldn't have called your mother.  c'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
 i don't want to be here. don't worry, i love you, daddy, i do. but i want to go home.
 i'm sorry for the screw-up. but i couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. i couldn't help it i had to stop at penny's for the costume. and you were hungry, remember.
 there's another thing i've been thinking about. i don't know how you feel about the idea, margie, because we've never talked about it. but i've been thinking lately, i've been thinking we should get married sometime. you and me.
 i'm her father -- supposed to be, but i'm not able to. yes. yes, i am. it may be the only thing in my life i've been so clear about wanting. even if it takes a big fight.
 yeah, but never what you looked like. not really. never really studied your face, like now. i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
 no. not for money. but  if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- i was pretty fucked up, you know.
 ...jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. he used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. now he's like everyone else.
 jack's sort of sensitive, i guess. more than most. but he'll be okay in a few weeks.
 i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop. i was a careful child and i became a careful adult, but at least i wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
 it wasn't me. i wasn't there, but i heard about it. when i heard about it, it was about elbourne.
 it may have happened, but not the way you said.
 i hate to disappoint you, but i don't think it happened.
 yeah. she'll probably quit her job and stay out here with pop. we can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. with jill here a lot, it'll be good to have margie around. things are going to change in that department, by the way. i got a custody lawyer in concord. i'm gonna see him tomorrow. all hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
 no, no, i haven't. not really. i've growled a little, but i haven't bit.
 no, not tonight. i'm in bed too. i'm calling because i need you to listen. you're supposed to be a smart guy. you're a professor. i got this theory. jack says he didn't see twombley shot but he did.
 wade, it's late. i know you're probably at toby's, but i'm in bed reading. we got different habits.
 i know...  but lotsa times i feel like it's me versus the world.  some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh.  i mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
 i hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
 we've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
 please. you can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
 or you will do what, mrs. marshall?  but i admire your courage. your husband, on the other hand...
 no. but since i only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps i will start with your family instead... gibbs.
 we can't jump from here or at this speed. but if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
 they're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
 we can't go back.  we had something very special, but it's all over.
 women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  but after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
 thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on thursdays.
 sure.  but that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
 we were in love but i'm not sure i know what love is anymore.
 i'm sure we'll both make it.. but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
 that's a lovely name. mine's milton...milt ettenhenim. but my friends call me 'bubbles.'
 .. but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
 yeah, something like that, but as i say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
 well, i flew single-engine fighters in the air force, but this plane has four engines. it's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
 i think you ought to know what our chances are. the life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
 it's a big building with patients. but that's not important right now. tell the captain i must speak to him.
 it's a big building where the generals meet. but that's not important right now. they've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. isn't that good news?
 elaine, just hear me out. i know things haven't been right for a long time. but it will be different...like it was in the beginning. remember?
 i have been patient and i've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
 i know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. if you'll just be patient, i can work things out.
 i think so, but i've never seen it so acute.
 i think you're the greatest. but my dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
 i'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. my name is roger murdock. i'm the co-pilot.
 i will, but jim won't.
 all right. but just remember, my name is roger murdock.
 well, i flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. i wouldn't know anything about it.
 it's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. but that's not important right now. the first officer is ill and the captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. do you know anything about planes?
 your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
 i think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  a little scared... and a lot curious.  maybe more than you want to admit.  but doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  think of it as broadening your horizons.
 there's lots of things i haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  don't take it personally.
 i may be an asshole, but at least i'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
 you understand that.  but how many others will?
 i never thought i'd say this, but -- for once in my life i think i'm willing to wait for back-up.
 no he's not.  not if he overdosed on the drug.  massive amounts trigger a... a change.  your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  when you emerge you're...
 no... i am sure not.  that is why i am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  but none of my people know how to make it.  the process was carefully guarded.
 you humans are very curious to us. you invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  you lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... you give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  you aspire to very high ideals here.
 it's like having an eleventh finger removed.  it hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
 ss'loka'.  it means literally "small but intelligent creature".  it loses much in the translation.
 that's very colorful.  but see -- now i've got a problem.  i don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, porter.  so i guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
 agree to work with me?  you don't like me... you don't like any of us. you have nothing but contempt for us.  and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
 he has not been home since that day. but she told me where to find him.
 she didn't know him.  but she said her son might.
 the guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but i don't think that's what they were there for.  i think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, george...
 there was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
 to be honest, it's hard to say.  i hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
 no i.d. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
 i'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. believe me, i'd prefer not to.  i may be synthetic but i'm not stupid.
 hard to say.  it may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever.. but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  that's if she exists, of course.
 well, i mean...i know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  let's move cautiously.  first, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
 look, i believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  you got feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
 look, we don't know what's going on out there.  it may just be a down transmitter.  but if it's not, i want you there...as an advisor.  that's all.
 they're but off!  do something!
 unknown.  but  it looks like all of them.  over at the processing station...sublevel 'c' under the south tower.
 i want you two walking the perimeter. i know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. we've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
 all right!  she's alive.  i believe it.  but we gotta get moving!  now!
 maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
 my mommy always said there were no monsters.  no real ones.  but there are.
 look, i can see where this is going.  but i'm telling you those things exist.  back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  thousands. do you understand?  i suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
 this is my wife, stanzi. i've been sick, but i'm all right now. aren't i?
 that's very tempting, but it's impossible, i'm afraid. wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. you see, they're all originals.
 how charming.  but why did he not come himself?
 he's not in. but he's working on it. he said to tell you.
 i am sorry, madame, but no! i cannot let anyone pass.
 i am sorry, madame, but i have my orders.
 i was. but she quite outgrew the little i could show her.
 majesty, i did. believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. but finally, i simply could not recommend herr mozart.
 ah-ha. favouritism. but i so want mozart.
 excuse me, sire, but what do you think these could be? being a foreigner, i would love to learn.
 let's have some fun.  bring in herr mozart, please. but slowly, slowly. i need a minute to practice.
 you are passionate, mozart! but you do not persuade.
 forgive me, majesty. i'm a vulgar man. but i assure you, my music is not.
 mozart, i am a tolerant man. i do not censor things lightly. when i do, i have good reason. figaro is a bad play. it stirs up hatred between the classes. in france it has caused nothing but bitterness. my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. i do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
 excuse me, but how old are you?
 i agree, majesty, but i'm afraid it's not possible. the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop.
 it's too dangerous, papa. but they're going to love it. ah, there she is!
 oh we could, if we wanted to, but stanzi won't hear of it. she wants to do everything herself.
 isn't he marvelous? he cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. i tell you, if you'd played don giovanni here it would have been a great success. i'm not joking. these people aren't fools. you could do something marvelous for them.
 no doubt, sir. but i am endowed with talent, and you with money. if i offer mine, you should offer yours.
 you know, it's all here in my head. it's just ready to be set down. but when i'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. i can't write.
 another? but that's too soon! tomorrow night? it's impossible! did he say a hundred?
 i don't have it yet. it's not finished. i'm sorry, but i need more time.
 oh no! one hears such sounds and what can one say, but - salieri!
 i don't know. they say i've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. i can't rewrite what's perfect. can't you talk to him?
 they're stupendously successful. you can't get a seat. the only problem is none will hire me. they all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. as if i was some kind of fiend. i'm not a fiend!
 no, but i'm broke. i'm always broke. i don't know why.
 sommer? herr sommer? but the man's a fool! he's a total mediocrity.
 my dear mozart, there is no one in the world i would rather help, but now it is too late.
 a funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
 yes, but this is not a ballet. this is a dance at figaro's wedding.
 no, but i'm the best.
 elevated? what does that mean? elevated! the only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. i'm sorry. i'm stupid. but i am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! old dead legends! how can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
 sire, only opera can do this. in a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. no one can understand a word. but with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. isn't that marvelous?
 i know we banned this play, but frankly i can't remember why. can you refresh my memory, herr director?
 well, i don't know! i mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
 he didn't say, sir. i told him i didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
 she didn't say. but she says it's urgent.
 i'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! i push things about, but i've little say what happens to them.
 i doubt it. but it's something to do.
 yes, he is. he's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
 oh, i don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. but in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
 well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
 alex, i've lost my mind. i woke up at the zoo! but you know what? i feel terrific!
 yeah, i do, but go to work.
 now, david, i said i would keep you company, but i meant right here and now.
 a connecticut yankee in king arthur's court by samuel l. clemens. this is after the preface but before chapter one: a word of explanation. you all right?
 no, but we're about to.
 yes, but does everyone kill bambi?
 look, dr. hirsch, i know i've been traumatized, but jack was torn apart. i saw him. a man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
 sure, as a kid. but never so real. never so bizarre.
 you've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. you'll have some dueling scars to boast of. that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. they say a mad man has the strength of ten.
 david, i'm sorry i upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
 i'm a grisly sight, it's true; but i love you and that's why i'm here. you've got to know.
 david, now i know this may be hard for you, but i have to warn you.
 i'm sorry to be upsetting you, david, but i had to come.
 i'm aware that i don't look so great, but i thought you'd be glad to see me.
 no, but he was on the moors.
 the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but i hardly think...
 oh, that's been there for two hundred years. we were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
 i'll tell you why. i don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  personally, you can have all the credit you want. but for that deal - not a cent.
 dickson doesn't have to go. but he must agree to this merger with new york trust�
 i can't? you just wait and see. if that run doesn't stop within the next hour, i'll shut the doors. you know what that means? the bank examiner will step in tomorrow. you'll be forced to liquidate. i'll insist upon it. the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. what's left you gentlemen can have. but i'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
 no. you can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. we pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. now you want our help. you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. all right. there's one way you can get it. give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
 that sounds very simple, dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
 i know, dickson. that's all very well. but you're taking too many chances. in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. in case of emergency!
 he won't believe it, mr. dickson. but it's the truth - honest it is. i was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she�
 no. no, i'm not. i deliberately avoided you. i was afraid of making a fool of myself. but i won't stand it any longer�
 listen, dear. i want to ask you something. i know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . i want you to tell me the truth. where were you last night?
 listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
 ho, ho, ho, yourself! i wouldn't laugh if i were you. you may not suspect it, but i'm still attractive - to some.
 wait a minute. wait a minute.  matt, do you realize you're up against something? you're being charged with murder. it's serious, son. now come on, i know you didn't do it.  but we've got to make them believe it. come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
 maybe. but i'm taking no chances.  why, this kid's got a record.
 i hate to do this, but i've got to have time to dig up some help. i think i know where i can get some real cash. snap into it, sampson. we will lick this thing yet.
 get all the big bills in the place. take them out and get them changed. get nothing but ones and fives. distribute them among the tellers. tell them to take their time. stall as much as possible. count and recount the money.
 yes, sir. but soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
 well, take my word for it, and don't try it. it's useless!  if it were some other woman, i could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
 okay, honey - but just the same i'd like to take a crack at that�
 who? cluett? no, not yet. but i'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
 not yet. but i'm hoping.
 because we were good at it?  hell, we were great at it. jesse, don't tell anyone i said this, because everybody knows i'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
 i have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
 go ahead to the saloon. but don't get too drunk!
 i'm upset too, zee, but jesse and cole know what they're doing. i'm sure they won't press their luck.
 the bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. praying wouldn't hurt.
 pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get mad bob younger under control!
 everything but the boring parts.
 i know. but that's how it should have ended. your dad and mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
 i'd just as soon kill you, jesse james. but chasing you takes up too much of my time.
 no, i'll hang you.  but i may miss you just a bit.
 not that day. i am guilty of many things, but that was mr. thaddeus rains and parker, that day.
 oh, it's a similar room. but the hotel is in washington d.c. you're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of jesse james sympathizers.
 i could have lied i suppose, but i want this marriage to be legal. i just want you to know, i'm trying to start a new life here. i'm depending on your...
 yes, but just so i could find out who you were.
 first of all: you, shut up.  now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. every time the james gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. but there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. this gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
 pinkerton. it's been eight months. i see robberies. i see hold ups. but i do not see men on the end of nooses.
 "a rock island and pacific railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside st. louis, missouri. the brave and daring james-younger gang was heavily outnumbered by pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the west."
 oh no, i would have done that. but i would have made sure i killed them, too.
 courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. new york magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." you'll love it. and then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. i think that'll follow nicely.
 i'm not supposed to.  but i can make an exception.
 my need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but i have no other way to fulfill my needs.
 you'll notice that my friends and i all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. mcdermott is the biggest asshole. van patten is the yes man. price is the most wired. i'm the best looking. we all have light tans. right now i'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and van patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
 davis. i'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. but come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that i couldn't fully appreciate it. i wasn't fooled for a second. now, if you'd said price, or mcdermott...otherwise, it was amusing. now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. hilarious, davis. a killer.
 oh come on. price. there are a lot more important problems than sri lanka to worry about. sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
 it's definitely weak but i have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
 i'm not sure, guy, but i don't think dyslexia is a virus.
 umm...yes...i know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
 well, i guess i do. for a long time i was too focused on my work, i think, but now i've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
 i'm on a diet. but thank you.
 isn't it ridiculous? coming all the way up here, but you know. they really are the best.
 oh, right. of course...we had wanted paul owen to come. but he said he had plans...i guess i had dinner with victoria...the following night.
 listen, i'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when i've sorted out all this information?
 i actually came to see timothy price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
 well, i've had a hard time getting an actual verification. a stephen hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but i checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a hubert ainsworth for paul, so...
 pardon me, but are you okay?
 i'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but i was supposed to talk to luis carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...i know how busy you guys can get.
 they're okay. bateman their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. but then sports came out in 1983, i think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
 i could tell you that, halberstam, but then i'd have to kill you.
 what shit? now where do we have reservations at? i mean i'm not really hungry, but i would like to have reservations somewhere.
 anything? that's not even credible. if he wants to go up there? to check it out? i think you should encourage him.  it's his life. but everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. you're hurting your own case.
 i know you think i'm too attached to him, but still. i am close to gary. and you're the most meaningful person in my life.  i'm going back to the comix place, why should i be killing myself.
 i know how to get in there. but you've gotta help me.
 if there's a civil rights violation. but generally we let the local police and da do their work first.
 no. but you can write your own ticket in the valley after this. we're gonna bring down outpost.
 i do know. you focus on the big problem. but somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. something gets destroyed. at first it's upsetting. you feel you've lost control.
 i'm pretty close. but when i wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. you know what it's like, writing software.
 i do know, gary. i feel the same way. i thought i was coming here for a job. but it's meant a lot more.
 "dear lisa. i've enjoyed working with you. i'd be lying if i didn't say i find you attractive. but in my heart i know that alice..."  you left my party to send e-mail?
 34,000. but they're real short lines. 'just came out that way.
 the purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. but the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. being obsessive isn't a crime. it's a character trait.
 you'd have to start practically from scratch. but this is all you'd be working on. no marketing meetings, no product seminars. we can't waste the time. half the valley's working on convergence. so're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'can't finish second, milo. there is no second... now what would you like to ask me?
 get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  what would milo want in here, anyway?
 not yet. 'love to bust my ass cause i'm not in frigging mensa.  i swear to god, it's that kid milo, i told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  let's run a printout on card entries.
 he suspects i know something. i think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case i do.  we have to go in tonight. i'm two hours from a beta version.  but i've gotta go home for an hour.
 time-warner has a 40 per cent stake in gary's set-top device. that also takes out cnn.  "ge joins outpost in new venture," which means nbc is out. "disney joins outpost," abc is out. "outpost and newscorp in new deal," fox is out. any of these places could have a mole. or all of 'em.  it's like a a continuous loop. we can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something gary's got a finger in!
 we could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. but not on our own computers. not even at home.
 right. but gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. have to be careful who we pick.
 it's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. they upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. they'd be happy just to steal code forever. but when a program gets close to fruition. like teddy. he was almost there.
 you thought about it too. you've been suspicious for a while. but it's not happening in there. it's happening in the day care.
 then and now.  but not right now.
 right, right. but does he ever just, like, hand you code?
 no, i know what you mean. i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. least they make sense. sometimes you think they've betrayed you. like a person would. but then you see, no, you just missed a step. you can go back and make it all work.
 a beautiful geek? i don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
 no! i keep thinking it'll go away. but there's this -- connection. she's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. plus i see her every day, we're working on the same program. she's -- beautiful.
 #21. way behind schedule. it's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. they see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
 every geek here's got a thing for lisa. but that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
 i'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. but first, tell me another poem.
 it's for the mining industry, mr. cunningham. we can talk about business later. but first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
 virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. how did you know?
 you must admit, she is rather mannish. no offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
 that's why right now is a very groovy time, man. we still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
 no, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. we were innocent, man. if we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  it's freedom, man.
 she was very groovy. she was so in love with your dad. if there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your mum and treated her as well as you dad did, it was me. but  unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
 that cat number two has an x-ray eyepatch. i get bad vibes from him, man. listen, we should go back to the room, but first i have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
 i understand that, mr. powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. i will never have sex with you, ever.  if you were the last man on earth and i was the last woman on earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, i still would not have sex with you.
 mr. powers, please. i know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. i would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
 listen, mr. powers, i look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. you can address me as agent kensington. we have to leave immediately. we've preserved your private jet just as you left it. it's waiting at heathrow airport.
 well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. they actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
 it's about the sharks. since you were frozen, they've been placed on the endangered species list. we tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
 people have to tell me these things. i've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  ok, no problem. here's my second plan. back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth, which we scientists call the "ozone layer." slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. that is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
 we also own the franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  some plates, like the gone with the wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but  as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
 well, god knows he tried, but i've been rather firm with him, mummy. you didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. it's bizarre.
 ok, scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. they say it, but they don't mean it.
 ah, but you haven't see the real me. watch closely ...
 you and i. together. but first you must confront your greatest enemy. who could that be, mrs. peel? the answer is obvious ...
 quite right, but we still make the rules.
 i equivocated. but you're not their big worry at present. it's dr. darling:  he's disappeared ...
 exactly. there'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. propane gas mostly. in small quantities it captures chlorine. protects the ozone layer. but it proved impractical. too bulky ...
 no. but he must know. incidentally, my double left you with this.
 that's possible. sir august was convinced he'd met me before. but i'd never met him. another odd thing. when it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
 you can but i wish you wouldn't ...
 oh, absolutely, but trubshaw's a man worth meeting. no point setting out half shod.
 dyed in the wool. but i can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
 under the circumstances mother didn't see fit, but i think i can get you in ...
 are you suggesting that dr. darling and valentine were somehow in this together? but that's absurd.
 we had a lead to wonderland weather but we got there too late. someone tipped them off ...
 they'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. but don't worry about the dirty movies.
 no. as far as they're concerned the only good rick is a dead rick. but i don't care... it's my decision.
 i don't get it, but at least gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
 you know how that makes me feel, deb? wanta know how that makes me feel?  angry, deb.  yesss, that's the word, angry. but if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. i want you to be happy, deb.  no matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. be happy, deb. be oh, so very, very happy.
 yes, but looks are deceiving...  not in this case, however.
 this is bad public relations. i was planning to do a lot of business with you. but now i'm going to have to go elsewhere.
 let me finish. debbie's an adult. she can do what she wants. but if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. if i may make some suggestions...
 well, i have to admit my game's a little rusty, but i love polo. it's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. really a beautiful experience.
 excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the vatican.
 i know, sister, but i have a very good excuse.
 -- i tried, y'know? helen's right. i don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, i've got some.  look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe i shouldn't have gotten in the way. i'm your brother, not your father. go on. you gotta go somewhere? go...
 no, lt., i don't have a problem with drilling. but let's just have one drill. not one for the company and one for me.
 i know you cold, brian. the scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. but you see, in this job there's no place to hide. isn't like selling log cabins. you have a bad day here -- someone dies. and that's not fucking good enough. want another beer?
 see that trap door up there? that used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. it was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
 jesus, give him a break. there isn't enough proof yet to go public. sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. not 'till it's locked.
 yeah, but it doesn't take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
 marty did.  but i wanted you to come to.
 hey, sorry if i made you look bad in front of your boss. but i'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, i'm trying to do something here. there's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. tell swayzak to talk to one of them.
 i'm close... but i can't get who it is...
 sorry, but it's out of my hands. try again next year.
 -- i don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
 look, everybody remembers your old man. being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. dead hero father rule. but you blew us off. why should i take you back?
 it had to be someone who knows numbers. some kind of fancy accountant. but what's the connection?
 this is the copy of swayzak's manning report that was released. everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. they're all airtight.
 why backdrafts. whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
 i got it after we talked to ronald. torches. want to fry the whole goddamn world. but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. and he made his burns backdrafts.
 look, it isn't proof, okay? someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in cosgrove's clothes.
 temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. an accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
 in a fire? never.  look, i'm his brother. i care about him, y'know? he was going to get himself killed. maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. and i couldn't -- i just couldn't...
 y'know, i treated him better than any other probie i ever had. he probably hates my guts, but i did the best thing for him. i made him finally look in the mirror.
 i know he's out, but how's he doing?
 oh, but it's a good story, shadow. you're depriving our famous young friend here...
 i deal with this stuff every day. but a fireman... you never get used to it.  what happened up there? he was a candidate. did he pay attention? was he listening?
 first i'll put your uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, i'm gonna add some downtown. they call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  first time shooting up?
 ok. ok. fine. but -- do you believe in god?
 i'm not talking about the fucking church. fuck the church. but tell me. do you believe in god?
 that's no mystery. julio and paolo brought it in,  you don't want to hurt those boys, do you? i mean, they sure as hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the law wants to give them. you understand?  no. how could you understand.
 i also thought of that bread, father. and of that night six days ago when the mother superior died, and i kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve god?
 it's funny, you knew. but the first thing i think of is kneading the bread that i help bake for the soup kitchen. maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
 father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- no. i have sinned. and you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve god?
 sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. i expected that you would want to speak to me about it. but you could have come to my office. your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, sister, have done something wrong. you haven't. i assure you. i feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. if you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
 forgive me father, for i have sinned. it has been two days since my last confession. father, my sin is a terrible sin. a sin of omission. there was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin i think was graver stil.
 microphone check, one, two.  one, two.  yo tavis, i be lovin' yo show but mantan you is foul.  why you perpetrating?  you a sellout.
 i have this concept for a tv pilot. there's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
 yo, check it.  this is good and all that but one day soon i want to have much benjamins so i can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. you hear me.
 i'm always gonna be that.  but i ain't doing no more buck dancing.
 manray, i'm very sorry about ya boy cheeba and sloan.  believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  i feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  you gotta be professional.
 trust me.  of course i still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
 i seriously doubt that will ever happen.  didn't i tell you i know your people better than you do. but if by some miracle you're correct, i'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
 derrick coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas d.c. didn't want it bad enough.  delacroix, do you want it? bad enough to kill for it?  do you want it that much.
 probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  a black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  with this kid, the possibilities are endless.
 mantan and sleep 'n eat.  two real coons.  i know we're way out there but it's satire.
 the material you've been creating is too white bread.  white people with black faces.  the huxtable's, cosby, revolutionary.  but that's dead.  we can't go down that road again.
 i understand.  but again, in all honesty i was not informed.
 i'm sorry about my blowup but i have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
 i told you but you wouldn't listen. you never listened to me.
 that was a mistake, but i don't regret it.
 you can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  i know where i made my big mistake.  i have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
 not yet, but this thing will never get made.
 i perfectly understand where you're coming from.  as a minority i can relate to your struggle also.  but i think you should give us all a chance.  we want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
 let me ask you a question, if i may. how do you think she got the job in the first place?  i don't mean to burst your bubble, mantan the marvelous, but sloan is an opportunity.
 son, peerless is your name.  now you might be one of these hollywood types, change your name and all that but peerless dothan is on your birth certificate.
 it was.  it is.  but this is a different kind of show.
 i know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  through the roof.  but in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  i introduce you to myrna goldfarb. she's the best media consultant in the biz.
 i don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  mantan - the new millennium minstrel show is universal.  it's not just for negroes in compton or 125th in harlem.  this is america.  our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  i'm not gonna box myself in. this show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
 before we begin, i want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  you could have chosen mike wallace, barbara walters, jane pauley, whatnot but you're here.
 you know the use of arms very well, best, and no one can doubt your courage; but michael and i will see you home for all that.
 not yet, but i believe he intends to.
 i had thought you more expert.  you must find out if the chevalier cheats.  he sees the english and austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  if you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  but never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  he sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
 this may be a very good inn for germany, but it would not pass in old ireland.  corbach is only a league off, let us push on for corbach.
 my companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about england, which i answered as best i might.  but this best, i am bound to say, was bad enough.  i knew nothing about england, and i invented a thousand stories which i told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the british ambassador in berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
 no, the very same one, my boy.  he recovered from his wound.  the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  it was only made of tow. do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  but hit him you certainly did, roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. we told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
 grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which i wanted, of my family.
 a man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  i'll see the captain hanged before i apologize.
 look here, roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  the girl will marry best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  you are but a boy.  best is willing to consider you as such.  dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  make best an apology, and be off.
 it was with this sword that my late father, harry james, god rest his soul, met sir huddelstone fuddelstone, the hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  he was quite in the wrong, having insulted lady fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the brentford assembly.  but  like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
 dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but best will have to fight me before he marries her!
 ten thousand?  but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
 sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
 i can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
 no one, sir.  before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
 very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
 as soon as i saw you loved me, i was pleased, and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, i would never love you.  but after our first kiss, i found that i had no power over myself.  i did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
 shall i tell you something -- i believed what was called love came after the union -- and i was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  and so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, i was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
 our abstinence makes our love immortal.  if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now i should love you even more.  but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
 yes -- but i am afraid of being deceived.
 a man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
 i agree; but god put us on earth to take that risk.
 that is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
 many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  i could value only someone whom i loved.
 monster!  your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  but i'll have my revenge, i will!  roddy, will you see me insulted?
 i accept, but i insist on a wager. the loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
 oh, i am grateful to you, sir.  i am the wife of captain o'reilly hastening to join him at dublin.  my chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but  on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
 when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in birchin lane, london.  i requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to castle hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as messrs. sharp and salomon had been treated here.
 considering your financial circumstances, mr. cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. but  obviously, if you would reject this offer, i shall keep trying to find a better one.
 mr. newcombe, i have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
 sir william cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  he was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live i don't know how many years.  if cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  but my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
 well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? no man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  for instance, i have got the gout; who tends me?  a hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  my wife never comes near me.  what friend have i?  none in the wide world.  men of the world, as you and i are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
 in truth, sir, yes, but  if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
 hang it, mr. roderick james, you have no more manners than a barber, and i think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and i like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
 i made sir william cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  one could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
 west was one thing, but this --
 okay... but i would like to know about the other cadets. what they were like -- nice guys?
 one went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- i thought you knew this --
 i hated west, childs hated west, everyone with a goddamn brain hated west but that doesn't mean we killed him!
 ray, this is my life here. i ain't gonna pretend i'm not happy west is gone, but you know i couldn't have done this. it's not in me.
 maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
 i honestly don't know. maybe to have someone to cover for him. and i wish i could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
 right in front of us. mueller went after him but we held him back.
 maybe i shouldn't tell you that. maybe i should tell you i wasn't scared at all. but i was...  enough to almost kill him.
 levi, i don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
 you... i've seen you around the base. but you...  you're not army, are you?
 you can't duck this, bill. i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i won't let this happen.
 no more witnesses. west's a ghost. but it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and kendall's toxicology report. and that'll be enough.
 what i can't understand is why you signed these. if you'd just let west take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
 if you let him testify then it would have all come out. west was supposed to take care of it out there, shut nunez up and then disappear. but it got messy and people got killed. so you called your old pal tom hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
 maybe. but it's my fault and i'll carry it.
 from dunbar? i hate to break this to you, but i don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
 the official term for it is "clusterfuck". by the time beth hit us, i'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush. we're missing three and the sergeant. the cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. but the sergeant...
 yeah. but he was a lot of other things, too. thanks.
 nobody saw. but i don't think so.
 kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
 so it's a good plan but it goes wrong; mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story --
 look, all we've got is what kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except nunez. he found west, he saw mueller and pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
 that means under a year. let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. there are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. dunbar's our guy.
 someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. maybe nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their sergeant's killers! we'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
 mueller. he's as bad as west and we both know it. now i can't do it, cause i'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
 a gay senator's son who let his sarge get fragged on a training exercise? the press'll crucify you and your father. his career will be over and it'll be your fault. but we do this different and you come out a hero.
 we did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  it was because i threatened him.
 no, but it got you interested, didn't it? got you to dig. inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
 i was wrong about you kid. you may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. you could get any girl.
 a few rabbits, but i think one of them was already dead.
 i just saw the woman i'm going to marry, i know it. but then i lost her.
 this town is everything a man could ask for. and if i were to end up here, i'd consider myself lucky. but the fact is, i'm not ready to end up anywhere.
 i didn't forget. i was just working on a tangent. see, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
 well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
 means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  like one night, i had a dream where this crow came and told me, "your aunt is going to die." i was so scared i woke up my parents. they told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. but the next morning, my aunt stacy was dead.
 i love every square inch of it. but i can feel the edges closing in on me. a man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  so what do you say? join me?
 mine's edward. and truthfully, i do want you to leave, karl. but i want to leave with you.  you think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. i can't see staying here a day longer.
 i have been nothing but myself since the day i was born. and if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
 only on the surface. but that's all i've ever seen.
 no, but i hear it's terrible. then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
 i am. and you're will. i've seen your picture, that's how i recognize you. i almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  like this.
 look, i know why you like him. i know why everyone likes him. but i need you to tell me i'm not crazy.
 you have to understand. when i was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. and i started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. with another house, another family. he leaves us, he goes to them. or maybe there is no family. maybe he never wanted a family. but whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. and the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
 i suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. but we sold that right away. your cousin shirley bought it.
 no. but it's weird. she seemed to recognize me.
 well, clearly you don't. but i'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
 true. but i've known him my whole life, and i don't feel like i know him at all. or ever will.
 yes. but that's a different...
 i don't know if you've seen it, but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek.
 it's very strange. how many people are truly themselves with their love? it is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. there are no marches against heartache, no ministries against loneliness, no concerts against disappointment. we look away. and still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. the one thing we all share but don't say. look john i will show you something.
 and what? you mean from the beginning? jesus. can i uh okay, as we say in russia can i cut a long story short. okay. nadia is my little cousin. except she's not. but we say cousin. this is for you.
 hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
 no. but you tend to tie them up.
 oh, i don't know. in my job as deputy assistant of new business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. this took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. but  you see, i'm not in that line of work anymore. nowadays i'm a bank robber.
 it's about forty miles from here. i don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to london but it's a city in itself. a roman city. it's a nice house. i'm having a problem with ants. i uh... it's the warmer weather. i can't seem to find the nest. sorry, do you understand "ants"?
 laz. i'm gonna put my trust in you. i'm gonna do it knowin' all too well i can get hurt like this. and i have been hurt. just like you.  woman like me, i got a lot of livin' to do. but my days are precious to me. they all i got left. don't want no more fuss. i want love in my life. you understanding me, laz?
 i lied to you. it was wrong. but at the time... i didn't know what to do. imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal i's carryin'...
 hey. you wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. hope you don't mind me comin' over.
 my sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. i just copied her prescription. you don't need to pay anything... just take it. but if she gets worse, you give me a call. i wrote my number on the box.
 i know about how she was like. but we was different. i's the only person she talked to about it. how she's abused. terrible things, gill, just terrible...
 they been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. thought it was just some tic i got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  i can't... shoot. target practice i'm a pro. i tag between the numbers each time but...  but when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. i get shaky and... i lose my breath. they called it anxiety. severe anxiety. it can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  it's a long process but... they sent me home.
 rose. folks get sick. but you do what you can to get on the mend. our marriage... it just got sick. that's all.
 say what you gotta say, but i ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. not never. you hear?
 i've had nice things before but i always ruined 'em somehow.
 i know you didn't. but you a grown girl. you can handle it. i got to.
 my god, gal, don't you got no sense? i ain't sayin' i ain't weak? shit. playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  i got sin in me! i ain't go'n lie! but i got respect! and all you got is bile, gal!
 look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. i'll do whatever you want. but you gotta let me go. you can't do this! you can't keep me here!
 i ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... remember like i say, i found you in the road...
 it got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. got fresh 22's on her. ain't my doin'. that's just how it came to me. don't worry. nobody gonna come lookin' for it. i got the pinks... got no problem.  ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
 she got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, i'm different. sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. girl got an itch. you know... what's a nigga to do?
 and now these three remain: faith, hope and love. but the greatest of these is love.  who gives this girl in marriage?
 i don't know, but i been told, them georgia women sweet jelly roll.
 i never laid a hand on her in anger. not a day. not even when i's drinkin'. but this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
 it starts like this... fire... that spreads. starts in my head. then moves to my stomach. then it goes lower. i can stop it sometimes but mostly i just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when i met ronnie.  cuz i love him so much. he's all i got in my life that's special. and i like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. when i can do that for him... it's like i'm givin' somethin' of myself that i haven't givin' nobody else.
 now see? don't do that. i'll go along with all you say about me. but that... you can't pretend no more on that. cuz i was just a kid, momma.  i didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  and you let him do it. some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only somebody you had.
 what we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. i ain't callin' you no ho. but i ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. remember... you called me.
 ... he's a sorry old guy, but i like him.
 i'd invite you up but i know you'd hate the incense.  i chant.
 sure, but then i just pull out the photos.
 i took kobo from the street.  i gave him a home, a future... but my ways were too slow for him... i served seven years in prison for my boss when i was a young man.  kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his oyabun.  he was supposed to take over this syndicate when i retired.
 i'm impressed.  but let's use the short form.  i'm looking for --
 put it this way.  rolls royces are made to last -- as least they were. but i'm afraid you're a ferrari. a high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
 be better if i could talk to him in person.  but he's not an easy man to get to.
 i don't know much about biomechanics, roy.  i wish i did, but you're out of my league.
 okay, but don't kill him.  save a little for everybody.  a masterpiece.
 there wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  but bio- chemical data and morphology records of the nexus-6 were reported missing.  going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send holden in to run voight-kampff tests on the new employees.  guess he found himself one.
 machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  i don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  if that's true, whoever made esper should have been shot.
 two months.  but this one is not guy.  it is girl.  his girl.
 i'll but you one.  what'll you have?
 i know what they are, deck -- look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
 yeah.  but that's what i wanted to talk to you about.
 i'm great.  i mean, i know i'm not really great, but i feel just great.  how you like my new suit?
 listen, i could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but i still rather be here than up there.
 silicone valley.  lots of these science guys never leave that place.  we book two shows a month in there. those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
 i didn't know if i wanted to handle her -- i already got a snake act.  but my partner goes down there to the opera house on suck night to book the good ones.
 this one looks familiar, but i don't know.  naw.  there's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
 hey!  do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
 sounds like i'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
 i know you think it complicates your work, but i'm here to help.
 memory implant.  she was programmed. but i think she has transcended her conditioning.  i think she was beginning to suspect.
 nothing is infallible, but so far the voight-kampff scale bas been foolproof.
 already had i.q. test this year -- but i don't think i never had a...
 as a matter of fact i did.  they've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
 i have some, but i have to find out where they are staying.
 we work on rodeo drive.  but we're both professional dancers.
 i thank you very much for the invitation, but i'm quite busy today. perhaps i could see you tomorrow.
 eve, i don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me cliff, but eve, isn't cliff just a butt with hair?
 thank you very much. but  cliff, that's my seat. and i was just--
 could i please just go home?  i was lost, but this morning i found home and i promise not to bother any of you ever again.
 adam...dumb question, but humor me. have you ever had sex before?
 i've never lied to you.  i've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but i've never lied.
 maybe. but that's how it works.
 yes, i have a dictionary. but i can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  or why cliff would say that about you.
 yes it is. a girlfriend maybe. but a wife? i mean...
 okay. but you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
 well, i could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from pasadena...that could take some time.
 adam?  don't even think about it. okay? i'm sorry.  i know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if i didn't say it. okay?
 you know, eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but  i'd just be lost without you.
 well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
 it never works out because i'm into legs and butts and hair myself! that's why! so i wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than i am, if you can picture that. now, if you'll excuse me, i have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
 oh, stop that!  god! listen, i know you like me.  i can tell. but you know what? a lot of guys like me.  not me, exactly. it's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  or some combination of the above.
 see? i'm psychic. not completely, but pretty much. that was pretty good, wasn't it?!
 yes, ma'am.  but my name is adam.
 i know it has been terrible.  but it wasn't your fault. and now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. you understand?
 yes!  yes!  oh, lord!  yes, oh, yes! but  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
 dad, i don't know how to tell you this. and i was going to wait a while, but i think...dad,there was no bomb. a plane crashed into our backyard. i looked it up in old newspapers.
 this is what money looks like.  it comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  or you can have an "investment."  these are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
 i can't explain it now.  but i want you to set the locks for two months. you have more than enough of everything.  then we'll be back to get you.
 ...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  but we've got to hurry.
 oh, adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. one who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from pasadena. nothing against valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from pasadena, i don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
 i don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, i want you to look for something called a holiday inn. write that down. it's a hotel. there might still be one standing.
 he seems to be doing all right now.  i don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. but we  need supplies and i've got to stay with him.
 i was frightened and i didn't know what to think! but you know-i believe him. i think he just wants to go home. wherever the hell that is...
 you know, i don't think so. i'm confused but you know, i don't think he'd ever hurt me. i don't think he'd hurt anyone.
 they've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. people throw up in the streets. others point guns. there's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and i...i can't tell you the rest.  i just can't.
 i believe there will be other survivors. in fact, i'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. it's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. and i don't just mean the cockroaches.
 yes, he's very bright, dear. much like his father. but you know, calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
 oh, much worse. but not as bad as that mexican jumping bean dip. you remember that?
 you know, i asked him about that. and he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. see, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. i didn't know that. i thought it was a way of appearing superior.  know what else he told me?
 yeah. but who's not a slut these days?
 it's not so much what you say but how you say it.  women like men who are unpredictable.
 i'm sorry. but if the shoe fits.
 aunt barbara. i love you, but you're not gonna get it.
 i have no hard proof of any of this. her address is also on the photos. i think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. i think frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow frank is getting all their drugs. i had to tell you i got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. i had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
 hi. hi sandy. i'm sorry to bother you, but i've got to talk to you.
 detective williams here. yeah. tell him to go to sergeant milton. yeah, copy.  well, jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. very interesting. i know you must be curious to know more.  but. i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. one day, when it's all sewed up, i'll let you know all the details. right now, though, i can't.
 by the way, jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and i'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. got it?
 no. not really.  but also because i really want you to be alright.
 men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  it's burning me, but i love you. i do, i do. did you know that? did you know that i love you?
 no. but you're in very big trouble.
 i looked for you in my closet tonight.  it's crazy, i don't know where you came from, but i like you.
 go then. i can't let you put it in me now but i want you. i like you.
 i sprayed your apartment. i took your key. i really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
 yeah, but get outta here. he's comin' back.
 yeah. i sure know that. yeah, but how many more are out there?
 you can't just stay out half the night and carry on, jeffrey. there's got to be some order, jeffrey. i thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
 i've made arrangements with dr. gynde for 10:30. but jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; i need the car this morning.
 nice of you to offer, jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. i'm sure sandy will be back soon.
 i mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
 okay, but i promise i won't mention you. okay? i'll see him at the police station, okay? see you friday night, if not before.
 great. hey, i've got a bit of a problem. i know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
 maybe. but i think the yellow man is on drugs. i think frank supplies him.
 nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
 yeah, but i don't think it's going to do much good. let's go. i'll try to talk to him later.
 no, silly - i'm still in school you know. but i'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. you better be careful, jeffrey.
 ok. it's a strange world, sandy. this is what i have found out. what i think i have found out. dorothy vallens is married to a man named don. they have a son. i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of don's ears. i think he is holding them to make her do things for him. i think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. i call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. i don't know what he does but i think he's on drugs supplied by frank. frank is a very dangerous man.
 yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. i'll walk over to your house. i'll be there at eight o'clock.
 i don't want you to get involved, really, i mean, i do, but if something went wrong i mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
 you didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. i want to sneak in tonight. it's friday, do you have a date tonight?
 now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. i can stall if it's more, but i need time to find a good window, alright?
 i don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
 settle down. i have a plan which i think will work. there is very little for you to do, but i do need your help. aren't you curious about my plan?
 it's not bad, but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.  i used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
 there were at least three, maybe four. but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. there's also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
 up his house. i don't know what's going on but i know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
 this kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. if he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. but it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. and even worse the kid is good at it. i mean i had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
 well, not armed. if they had guns, they'd have used them. but dangerous? oh yeah.
 no. no man. that's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. that's bullshit. i know these guys. i mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
 he knows you, man. he knows all you want is to move up. that's all. a smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. but a guy like you? knowin' this is your only chance? waitin' eighteen years?
 he probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. figure it out. shooter's dead on the scene. no in-depth investigation. it'd slide right off his back. 'cause as much as i love ya, you're not exactly don corleone. what would he be losing? a thirty- five year old delivery boy?
 shit. she's on every drug know to man. she'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. screw her.  but i do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
 it's all your fault. both you little bastards. i was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. the day your da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and i got nothin' ta live for.
 duffy. this look like a fucking post office to you? this guy came in here with intent. maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. the bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
 possible, but unlikely. the angles are too extreme. a guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. he wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? no way. had to be at least two.
 we're like 7-eleven. we ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
 yeah. and uh, he's pissed off. he says, "why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? and he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
 uh. okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! well... shit. okay, there's a white guy. he's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. but this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
 i don't think i ever said this to you. but it meant a lot to me the way you were after that swifty stuff happened.
 i'm not. but there's --
 mr. langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. cpr. i've never said this before, but frankly i thought anthony was dead. the veins in his face were all sticking out. his skin was blue. he truly did look dead.
 yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
 i know. but once you get inside you're home free.
 really. ok, dad. but seriously, anthony. these are fast shoes.
 yeah, but i can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. there's just not time for it.
 that's true. but what if they change the locks?
 i want to ask a favor, boys. one day, when i'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to abe henry. and remember me as a friend.
 yeah. i mean, i don't think about it all the time. but once in awhile i kind of go, woah. man.
 well, he agreed 100% that bob should be dropped. and he also agreed you were a liability. but he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
 as far as i can tell he hasn't thought his life through. he'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. but business?  you i can work with. you i could groom. dignan's not going to make it.
 sure, sure. he's a great person, and i'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. but i wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
 look at that woman. she's what? fifty? fifty-five? but she hasn't let herself go. i appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
 you know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
 yeah, but he still has the aggravation. three days sitting in a cell.
 well, i didn't mean to electrocute him. but the whole operation was my idea.
 i know it must of been a bad experience. but it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
 god. that does sound corny. oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. but it really kind of does.
 it could happen. this is the exact kind of place where it happens. but i don't want to scare you.
 ok, bob. i don't know his name. you know why? because i don't care. he's future man. but i care about you. and to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. will you get in the car, bob? this is stupid.
 in all probability nothing would of happened. but why take the chance? that's why i ran. i mean how many plants were even back there? five? ten?
 yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
 yeah, but don't tell anybody.
 you're going to need a boxman for this one. but that can be arranged.
 it's hard to swallow.  the confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? it's more calculated than sick.  what about nicky? she's the last one to see bourne in paris. she's the one he asks for. they disappear...
 my ass he does. you're playing with fire, pamela. marshall said nail him to the wall. i don't know how you interpreted that, but i don't think he meant repatriate him.
 conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. you have me his calendar for a couple of days, i'll prove he killed lincoln.  this is supposed to be definitive?
 i've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. i've shoveled shit on four continents. i'm due to retire next year and believe me, i need my pension, but if you think i'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. marshall too.  it had to be done.
 it was my job. my first time. your father was supposed to be alone. but then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  i had to change my plan.  you understand me?  you don't have to live like that anymore. thinking that.
 -- my coat -- but we should --
 she really did that? told you not to kill me?  i had a woman once. but after a while, what do you talk about? i mean, for us. the work. you can't tell them who you are...
 look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. we hang there awhile. i'll come back. i'll check it out. but right now we can't --
 .. but you're not -- you're not sure...
 -- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  you ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? you don't wonder that?
 they know!  they know you were here. they know you killed these two guys. they know you and conklin had something on the side. they don't know what it is, but they know!
 what it means in england -- and in scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. we were ambushed last night. but the scots dragged their dead away.
 didn't want your father to die either, did ya? but it happened.
 i will meet you, but only one way -- if robert the bruce is there, and puts his hand on my bible, and swears his loyalty to scotland.
 with cavalry -- not heavy, like the english, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
 no. but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. the balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
 he strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. but he sends his greetings -- and says that i speak for all the bruces. and for scotland.
 nor i! i want to live! i want a home and children and peace. i've asked god for those things. but he's brought me this sword. and if he wills that i must lay it down to have what he wants for my country, then i'll do that too.
 probably. but we can't win alone. we know that. this is the only way.
 i am the one who is rotting. but i think your face looks graver than mine.
 he will fight you forever. but what does he fight for? freedom first, and peace. so grant them.
 i'll invite you again, but your mother thinks i'm crazy.
 and i with you. but you must wake.
 no. but can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? or simply love me... because i love you?
 let us talk plainly. you invade england. but you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. the king proposes that you withdraw your attack. in return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which i am to pay to you personally.
 then tell me what a king is! is he a man who believes only what others believe? is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? there is strength in you. i see it. i know it.
 war finds me willing. i know it won't bring back all i have lost. but it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. for that we need a king. we need you.
 nobles? what does that mean -- to be noble? your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. but men don't follow titles, they follow courage! your arm speaks louder than your tongue. our people know you. noble and common, they respect you. if you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. and so would i.
 i'm no coward! i want what you want! but we need the nobles.
 no. but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other. if you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
 wait! ...i respect what you said. but remember, these men have lands, castles. much to risk.
 aye. but it won't let me dream.
 i was going to show this to the principal, but i wanted to talk to you first.
 i'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? i'm already late for work --
 well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but i've been putting it off.
 look, andrea, i'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. but there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
 fine. you'll get them, evan. but i think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
 now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
 i get the point, kiddo. but i'm not so bad, am i?
 the car doesn't vanish evan. the movie in your head has broken, that's all. but now i've re-spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car.
 shucks, i dunno. but maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
 i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr. miller took his shirt off --
 why not? but that's not how things wound up. i'm with lenny, lenny's your friend. and there it ends.
 when my folks split, they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. i couldn't stand my dad, but i knew if i moved to my mom's i'd never see you again.
 you wouldn't believe me. i mean, people always say, "you wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
 i can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. even the dinner tonight. it was beautiful, but...
 well i remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. why would that freak me out?
 hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
 no, but i think something really bad might've happened to us.
 most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
 it wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think i was a piece of shit.
 he tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
 yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. it was much more than we thought to get here. and then captain renault sees us and he is so kind. he wants to help us.
 such a bargain. but that is your decision?
 thank you, but i hardly think --
 excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to america.
 excuse me, monsieur rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. the cashier would like some money.
 hmmm. i happen to know that he gets ten percent. but he's worth twenty- five.
 it's certainly not good enough. but since i'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
 fine, but i would like to buy your cafe.
 he is a difficult customer, that rick. one never knows what he'll do or why. but it is worth a chance.
 not for sure, monsieur, but i will venture to guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick.
 i observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, monsieur. i am moved to make one more suggestion, why, i do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but  have you heard about signor ugarte and the letters of transit?
 well, good luck. but be careful.  you know you're being shadowed?
 she tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. for your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and i let her pretend.
 maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
 huh. but it's still a story without an ending. what about now?
 just before you and i were to leave paris together. a friend came and told me that victor was alive. they were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of paris. he was sick, he needed me. i wanted to tell you, but i, i didn't care. i knew, i knew you wouldn't have left paris, and the gestapo would have caught you. so i... well, well, you know the rest.
 it wasn't long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia. they needed him in prague, but there the gestapo were waiting for him. just a two-line item in the paper: "victor laszlo apprehended. sent to concentration camp." i was frantic. for months i tried to get word. then it came. he was dead, shot trying to escape. i was lonely. i had nothing. not even hope. then i met you.
 no. oh, richard, i'm sorry. i'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. if you don't help us, victor laszlo will die in casablanca.
 no. oh, richard, i'm sorry. i'm sorry, but  but you, you are our last hope. if you don't help us, victor laszlo will die in casablanca.
 i know how you feel about me, but i'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
 you can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
 i told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. well, won't you sit down?
 last night i saw what has happened to you. the rick i knew in paris, i could tell him. he'd understand. but the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, i'll be leaving casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris. if we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not casablanca, not last night.
 how nice. you remembered. but of course, that was the day the germans marched into paris.
 i meant to, but something always held me up. i love you very much, ilsa.
 well, mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if i were a woman and i...  were not around, i should be in love with rick. but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
 i know a good deal more about you than you suspect. i know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. the first evening i came here in this cafe, i knew there was something between you and ilsa. since no one is to blame, i, i demand no explanation. i ask only one thing. you won't give me the letters of transit. all right. but i want my wife to be safe. i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca.
 i appreciate it, but i don't accept it.
 yes. i found that a very expensive hobby, too. but then i never was much of a businessman.
 nothing important, but may i speak to him now?
 ilsa, i don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
 thank you. i hope you'll forgive me, captain, but the present french administration has not always been so cordial. may i present miss ilsa lund?
 i'm sure you'll excuse me if i am not gracious, but you see, major strasser, i'm a czechoslovakian.
 my dear major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
 oh, we germans must get used to all climates, from russia to the sahara. but perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
 my letter of transit? i could use a trip. but it doesn't make any difference about our bet. you still owe me ten thousand francs.
 maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
 well, rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
 what you just did for laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send ilsa away with him. i know a little about women, my friend. she went, but she knew you were lying.
 i suppose you know what you're doing, but i wonder if you realize what this means?
 yes, i know what you mean, but i've already spoken to ferrari. you'll still win at roulette.
 there's still something about this business i don't quite understand. miss lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
 well, i forgive you this time. but i'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. uh huh!
 well, i told strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. but i told my men to be especially destructive. you know how that impresses germans?  rick, have you got these letters of transit?
 oh, laugh if you will, but i happen to be familiar with your record. let me point out just two items. in 1935 you ran guns to ethiopia. in 1936, you fought in spain on the loyalist side.
 oh, but i just told you. --
 thank you. rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. that is the reason we permit you to remain open.
 you know, rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the blue parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. it will amuse your customers.
 one moment. tonight i'll be selling those for more money than even i have ever dreamed of, and then, addio casablanca! you know, rick, i have many friends in casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one i trust. will you keep these for me? please.
 oh, nothing. but when you first came to casablanca, i thought --
 please, boss, let's go. ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
 yeah, but i ain't got time to spend the money i make here.
 okay look, i know you're tired, i know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
 that's what i told the fish i caught. but i ate them anyway.
 look, i love the puppy.  i love you.  but i have to go.
 what do you want me to say?  that i thought i'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did?
 under the circumstances your overall health is good.  those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
 we're warriors, not desk jockeys.  we've got to be bold.  you always want all your ducks lined up.  but nothing's 100 percent.  it's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. hell, i'd take 40-60.  then roll the dice.
 look, i'm sorry about your plane.  but i couldn't risk being late into memphis.
 yeah. but sometimes i wish i could meet mine, anyway.
 i know who you mean. i think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
 no. you warned me. i didn't listen, but you warned me.
 i *helped* you not to think about wally. you were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. this is how i helped you, right?
 yes. but it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
 it should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. you have cramps?  they'll ease up, almost entirely. as long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
 no, but i work there--i like it. my dad's a lobsterman.
 she just plan misunderstand me--i was tryin' to give her my knife, i was just reachin' to touch her hand. but i understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
 i didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. you look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
 i haven't, either. but you *will*. the morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
 thanks, guys... i'd like to go with you. but i've got to move on.
 *no*! i don't want to know him! he's doing *missionary* work--in *india*! i wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. maybe he got killed in the war!
 you pickin' nothin' but cider apples, peaches--i hope you understand that.
 well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
 it's more like what aren't i doing. my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. we tried the venture capitalist route in the valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
 brutal day. they say the streets are lined with money down here, but i guess you have to know the secret handshake. what are you drinking?
 exactly. but the catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. it could kill a deal. but, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
 exactly. but the catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. it could kill a deal. but  wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
 here's where a little research comes in handy. corporate banks give out vp titles like calendars. it's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
 yeah, but come on... all i get to do is cry and get insulted.
 bullshit! you were scared, jake! you lost your nerve! you lost your confidence! you weren't being noble. you weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! admit it.
 having a gun pointed at you for one. it's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. three on a match, black cats... believe it. believe it all.
 fine. but only if we recover the cash.
 let's see... let's suppose he gets to customs and he gets caught. we get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. i don't much like that idea. then again, let's suppose he actually gets through customs. now, that'll be something. we recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. we double our money.
 this might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea i've ever heard.
 you laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. this is new york city, sister. public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. you know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? let's do the list... hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
 we meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. the corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
 you can't cheat an honest man. but a man like lionel dolby...
 i don't know what you're into with the king pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? we get a big piece. if we find out you're keeping us out, i may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to moonan myself. say something stupid if we got a deal, jake.
 don't get me wrong, jake. i like you boys. you guys are the steadiest business in town. but what can i say? twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
 thank you, sir. you know, i hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps i could give you something for her? it's a check. we split the cost on a few books and i haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. could you..?
 take it from me, you never do. but congratulations. nice to be married, isn't it?
 thank you. actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. she thinks i'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. think i've fooled her?
 listen to me! we don't have much time. we can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
 we were friends. i trusted him. i should have known it was weird. but  then again i was weird.
 he wasn't my boyfriend. i had a boyfriend at the time... what was his name? anyway, glenn was like thirty. i was only fifteen. but he was a nice guy. real sweet. liked to talk. we used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
 intuition. it doesn't make you yoda. like tonight. you killed that guy tonight. but i knew you would.
 whatever. but you... i get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. so why this?
 sorry about your wallet, but if you think i'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out visa and a bad fake i.d., you're fucking crazy.  jake.
 no, the corporate papers have to be legit. but you gotta score an i.d. a clean one. talk to suits. i gotta get us a banker.
 yeah, well we're still a little young for albany state prison. are you pissed about al? i'm pissed too, but i'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
 no. big con. one rag. one rag and we get out from under all this. but we need another shill.
 just an idea, but let's just fucking split. we'll meet up anywhere. akron or austin or atlanta. anywhere...
 i understand that, but i had my wallet stolen last night. is there any way..?
 no offense, but i've seen you fight. you gotta be kidding m-
 you really like that bitch don't you? i gotta tell you, i was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. you know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. but  if you're into her... that's cool.
 your buddy. that fat guy. the king couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. he didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. it ain't personal. it's business.
 okay. here's the thing... you fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. then it's blue river land for everybody. papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. usually it's the shape of an arrow. i hate to do it, but after this, i gotta give you the blowoff. we jake, jake?
 i saw you go up from the knecker, working that grind, learning the barnard's law and i thought, "the kid's a prodigy." but i know that if you're using these goods... so then i figure, what's worth that? you're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. who's the mark?
 literally. it's not a bad deal, gentleman. i get peace of mind. you get detective sheilds. but this is the best part, walter... walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. capice?
 do you want to know the first time i had a line on vig? he sent me a birthday card.  belated, but it's the thought, right? oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. but  then again you guys probably know him better than i do. in fact, i've only met the guy once. but now, now i have you. the next best thing. his partners. his "fix."
 ah, we all say that. but if we hate it, why do we do it?
 i've been watching you work. you're the best in the place. but you know that.
 well it is. but i know where i am.
 good god, no. but with skill like that, what do you want a job for? you don't need to work.
 -- i don't care about her. of course, i was angry. but not with you. the book is yours not mine. i was wrong, what i said about it. i hurt you, didn't i?
 i've set this up for you. call the golden lion and ask for mr reynolds, he's the manager. i don't know him personally, but i've spoken to his boss. don't say no, jacko. give yourself a break.
 don't be stubborn. the pay won't be grand, but it's regular. that's what you need, isn't it? i know you don't like taking my advice...
 the date's not set yet. i'll call you. one last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. but you know how to deal with cheats.
 it doesn't seem fair. you're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
 i know that. but you can now.
 absolutely not. but then, i'm a gemini and geminis don't believe in astrology.
 i loved the atmosphere. but it destroyed my poor mother.
 so it's mr clean. wise up, jack, this whole business is bent. the casino is nothing but legal theft. and that's ok. it's the system. half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. we earn our money.  i'm on your side, jack. i don't need an enemy.
 coming up to two years now.  but i was away for six months.
 you've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
 she was a real asset. but what could i do?
 this is our crow's nest. i'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
 we had the same rule at sun city, but it was impossible to check.
 we tried. but there wasn't enough business. the punters like company.
 true, but since this is so, i have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
 yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
 i read you, lieutenant doolittle, but i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. detonation will occur at the programmed time.
 ah, doolittle, i do have a malfunction on this readout, but i can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
 i can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, i think about back home, back home at malibu. i used to surf a lot, talby. i used to be a great surfer.
 it's funny, but i kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
 you haven't figured this out yet, have you?  you walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... but see it's really the other way around.  you think i'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
 i'm really glad we're having this conversation.  you're right.  i was angry at you.  but talking about it-- the scales have fallen from my eyes and i see now that it was all my fault.  can you ever forgive me?
 i was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  but you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- i don't know... it's just that the more i tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
 it concerns only jah.  but  in this case, i was the instrument of the most high.
 i shouldn't do this.  but i got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
 he's a mistake i made about six months before you did.  but don't feel bad. justine made the same mistake, along with renee, jada, tia, brooke--
 pretty much the same reasons i was crying.  but things will be better when we move to a new place.
 i know, honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
 civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  but logan and max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
 and i feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean i need to get involved.
 that's deep.  but before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
 you're a soldier, max.  that's what you were put here for.  but soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
 so, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... i'm turning lauren over to canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  they'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
 that's low, but this effects me how exactly?
 not that i don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
 i don't know what kind of game you're playing here but i'm out because you are a whack-job.
 i'm sorry.  it wasn't my intention.  but i had to see you.
 completely different situation.  i steal things in order to sell them.  for money. it's called commerce.  but some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
 like following me around and pestering the people i work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
 she may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  hot run to two-oh-two sansomme.
 they lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  but there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
 he says he got it from a woman.  doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
 shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
 no, but i broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what i'm saying?
 quite a mouth on a girl so young...  .. but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
 she's as much as said so.  but she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... it's just an ego thing with her.
 i know what you're thinking.  but the truth is, this other person is not someone i'm in love with.  as a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone i like much.  so in a technical sense, i'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
 hot run to 842 beulah, corner of haight... and you can tell your pal theo he just got his worthless ass fired. not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
 he's a little spoiled, but i know he does.
 right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
 sure, i have. but not one with ice in it, that's all.
 you're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. name?
 plenty, but it was all bad.
 just for the record, i understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
 this is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! not only are we on again for kiss in detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! i dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
 still too risky for my money.  we're running out of time here. this is kiss! a victory for one is a victory for the team. i'm sure i can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. we'll reconvene at that intersection...
 very funny, hawk. okay, i'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, i'm blaming you. i'll say you drugged me or something.
 but... but  st. bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
 never mind with the too bad shit. i got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
 dude, if it were dancing the way fred astaire did it, i'd give it my best shot. i'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. but this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
 you look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
 sorry, man, no can do. but i'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
 please, jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
 of course, but has that ever stopped me before? besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. no sweat... see you guys in school.
 what else can i do? oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? tickets? jeremiah, do you realize what this means? that you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! now you want to see the devil in the flesh. you want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in detroit no less!
 well then, i suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing kiss tickets. i realize this is detroit, but i personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as lucifer's kingdom. i'll return in a little while.
 just one, father, but boy was it a doozy.
 look, i want to live, but i don't know where the fuck i'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
 please sir, don't beat me up. i do have a kiss ticket, but not on me.
 i should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. what are the names of the four members of kiss?
 now that's better... but i still sense some students out there... who are afraid... just to say good morning!
 i know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
 a hundred and one, i think. every day she does the same thing. but there's never any mail.
 it's like this big force... that's in your brain. but sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
 i'm not. but you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
 well, yeah... ok, but you're not listening to me. there are other things that need to be taken into account here. like the whole spectrum of human emotion. you're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
 a lot of people. teachers. younger kids. it's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  but that's ok... because i know i deserve it.
 no... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. something about a matching serial number that got burned.  but i had to sign a form saying i wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
 i think i already have.  but now she won't even talk to me.
 thank you, donnie. and you're a good student. lazy... but a good student. unlike most of the others, you question mom and dad's rules.
 i don't know. that's a good question... but suffice to say that i am no longer your english teacher. they fired me.
 of course. a rabbit is not like us. it has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. i like bunnies and all. they're cute... and they're horny. and if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. but the only thing i've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
 donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a god. you are an agnostic. an agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of god... but does not deny the possibility that god exists.
 yeah, but if i told her about the other stuff about frank...
 i'd like to believe that i'm not... but i've just never seen any proof. so i just choose not to bother with it. it's, like, i could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. weighing the pros and cons. and in the end, i still wouldn't have any proof. so... i don't even debate it any more. because it's absurd.  i don't want to be alone.  so, does that make me, like, an atheist?
 okay, but it has to be a small one.
 yes. and believe me, of all the other mothers i would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. but none of the other mothers are able to go.
 please! don't say those words.  well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. this is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. and i have taken it upon myself to spearhead the jim cunningham defence campaign. but unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
 rose, i'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and i respect you as a woman. but after witnessing your son's behaviour today, i have... significant doubts...  our paths through life must be righteous. i urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
 excuse me... but what is the real issue here? the pta doesn't ban books from school.
 mr. cole... not only am i a teacher... but i am also a parent of a middlesex child. therefore, i am the only person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
 i never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. the whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
 simple. just say, "mom, i know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. all so i could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. but  y'know what? i'm quittin'." there. easy as pie.
 oh c'mon, i love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause peter needed a kidney.
 oh really -- i don't think so.  uh, amber, i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. and this...  this is why we have the rule. my goodness gracious, i couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. we have kids in the audience.
 nice mouth you got there, mom, but i -- i'm not goin' through this again.
 amber, i'm sorry. i really am. but you know the rules. all talent costumes hafta be okay'd by gladys before the pageant.
 i know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
 well, uh, i'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but  uh, maybe i could call you tonight.
 well, excuse me, annette, but i'm braggin' up your kid, here.  amber's gonna be the next diane sawyer, y'know...
 girls check in, but they don't check out.
 i'm sorry, dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "tina," it's seiko.
 suppose a pretty dame into my castle came - and let us say that i was going strong.  she might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
 i've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
 he could be playing solitaire, but i don't think so.
 not a bad idea.  if our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  now, i don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
 that's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
 i've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
 is that so?  i used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. now - let's talk this thing over.
 yes, but i'm not working for you any more.  i'm on the other side.
 i don't know about us, but i know he's-a got something...
 you was insulted, but you don't know it.
 no, but i shot some ducks.
 i've got just the place for a man like you but i'm too busy right now to do any digging.  what do you call your dog when you want him?
 i don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  look - what do you call your dog?
 he used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
 no, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
 yes, but i'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
 carry out this tragic folly if you will -- but i for one will not be a part of it.  i will stay here in freedonia.
 your excellency, please don't think me silly, but i'd love to have a picture of you.  i want to hang it in my bedroom.
 what can this mug offer you?  wealth and family.  i can't give you wealth...  .. but we can have a little family of our own.
 i'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
 i -- i may be wrong, but i suspect the secretary of war.
 well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  the bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  i'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
 well, maybe i am a little headstrong...  but  you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me.
 i haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  not that i care -- but where is your husband?
 ambassador trentino, i am indeed honored...  but you see - well - i --
 .. but would further cement the relations of our countries.
 i shouldn't be. we made great progress today. i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. he did rather well, too, but i had to lead him every step of the way. though frankly, at times i was unsure of who was leading whom.
 if he does it's his own fault! but i'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
 it was a nice try, treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
 fine, fine. you know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, treves. but you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
 yes, i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables. i'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
 ...as i said, it's only a physical problem... but i do feel that mr. merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
 speaking is one thing, treves, but can the man comprehend?
 it's only a physical problem. he has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. but he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. so if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and i'll make it clear.
 he's doing very well. in fact that's why i came to see you. i think that if i were to present mr. merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. if the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, i'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
 yes, i'm well aware of that. but this case is quite exceptional.
 you'll know presently. at the meeting of the society. but until then, i beg of you fox, keep it to yourself.
 no, but i certainly shall.
 it's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. you may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, mr. merrick. it is lights and music, gaiety and joy. it's... well, it's romance.
 i'm sorry i could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
 yes, soon i will start the main spire, but i must finish these columns first, how kind of her!
 no john, i can't. i can care for you, but i can't cure you.
 oh, no do not say that. you have been so kind to me. i was afraid to say too much. people always want me to be quiet. you wanted me to speak, but i was afraid. forgive me.
 you're right, mothershead, please forgive me... of course, i appreciate everything you've done for john, and i'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. but  i'm the physician in charge and i must do what i think best. i'm also very late, so please forgive me.
 i'm sure that if mr. merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. now i'm not expecting miracles. i'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but i do think that i can get him to speak for himself. i'm going to arrange things with carr gomm right now.  that was very good, john, very good. that's all for today. we shall do some more tomorrow. mothershead?
 parrots can do as much, mr. treves. it's all very nice, but i don't see the point. you know they won't let him stay here.
 perhaps you've got the time for that, mr. treves, i certainly don't. i've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. i don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? i'll be back later for his bath. and mr. carr gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. good day sir.
 yes... well, i want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. and bring up another breakfast. when you've done that, you and i shall give the man a bath. but  mothershead, i'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
 what does that matter? but you've... you've... felt like this before...
 that's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... we're...
 listen! maybe we won't get to hy- brasil! maybe we won't find the horn resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
 i don't know -- but i'm not afraid to try.
 we came to stop you waking the gods, erik! but i didn't want anyone to get hurt!
 it's not just your livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of all blacksmiths.
 yes, it is good. but i told him ten.
 i really want to, but tonight's important. test tomorrow.
 i can't. i want to, but i have to study.
 maybe gay isn't the right word. but  anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. heheh. my significant other... heh heh. and i guess on a certain level, i want to break it off, but i feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. do i end it? should i give it more time? i'm not happy, but what do i expect? relationships require work. you know the drill. the thing that i keep coming back to is, i'm not getting any younger, i want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? so then i think i should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- i mean, he's a good guy. it's not really settling. then i think maybe i'm just a victim of movies, y'know? that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. but then i think, no, this is what i really want, so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. you know? agreed? but then i think he is a good guy and... it's complicated. y'know?
 i sort of do. but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality. cleaned up enough to be erotic.
 no, it's our house! just tonight --  -- we're david and ruth laskin. which one do you want to be? i prefer to be ruth but i'm flexible.  alcohol! you make drinks. i'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more ruth. i'm ruthless at the moment.
 you should try xanax. i mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. like insurance.
 i can't tell you how happy i am to hear that. i mean, i don't mean i'm happy you're uncomfortable, but  yknow... i'm such a loser. every time i come to a party i tell myself i'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod.
 joel, i'm not a concept. i want you to just keep that in your head. too many guys think i'm a concept or i complete them or i'm going to make them alive, but i'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. don't assign me yours.
 sorry to track you down like this. i'm not a stalker. but i needed to see you.
 i don't like it either, but i'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
 yes, but i can't love a man named wally.
 i hired them to. we're in my brain. but i want it to stop, before i wake up and don't know you anymore.
 it's my favorite book. since i was a kid. it's about these toys. there's this part where the skin horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  i can't believe i'm crying already. he says, "it takes a long time. that's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. but these things don't matter at all, because once you are real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
 sounds good. but right now i should go.
 exactly! i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again, so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but i was really disappointment to be there with him. y'know? and that's where psychic stuff comes in. like, it just isn't right with him. y'know?
 that made me cry. but  anyway, we went up to boston, because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river. it gets frozen this time of year.
 i don't either. i used to. but i'm through with that. y'know, if i don't love my body, then i'm just lost. you know? with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  so, i've been seeing this guy...
 i like you. that's the thing about my psychic thing. i think that's my greatest psychic power, that i get a sense about people. my problem is i never trust it. but i get it. and with you i get that you're a really good guy.
 exactly. exactly! that's exactly my feeling about it. it's hard to know. like, okay, but how many times do i think something and it doesn't happen? that's what you're saying, right? you forget about those times. right?
 me neither. but sometimes i have premonitions, so, i don't know. maybe that's just coincidence. right? y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? y'know?
 i miss grade school. i don't know why i'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. when i went we called it elementary school. but i like grade school better. sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. i'd like to be from then. everyone wore hats. anyway, cheers!
 yeah. i'm not, like, a robert frost lover by any stretch. his stuff seems strictly grade school to me. but this made me cry for some reason. maybe because it is grade school. y'know?
 my embarrassing admission is i really like that you're nice. right now, anyway. i can't tell from one moment to the next what i'm going to like. but right now i'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. that was nice of you.
 i think. anyway, i've tried all their colors. more than once. i'm getting too old for this. but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. i apply my personality in a paste. you?
 it's okay if i sit closer? so i don't have to scream. not that i don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  but i don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
 i didn't want to go. i was too nervous. i thought, maybe you were a nut. but you were exciting. you called from upstairs.
 i didn't want to do this. but i had to or they would've called me a girl.
 maybe i'm making a mistake. maybe i just need to learn to live with this. first of all, i'll get over it. secondly, it happened. those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. who said that? churchill? i'm not sure. but i don't care. she did it to me. i have to rid myself of this. fuck her.
 well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. nothing you'll miss.
 i didn't make you. you thought it best.  but  look, i take full responsibility.
 really? i thought it was appropriate maybe. that's all.  i really admire the work that you do. i know it's not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we're outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to --
 not a dump, then, but kind of plain. uninspired. and there's a stale smell. sort of stuffy. i don't know. stuffy.
 yes, everything is getting worse. but everything is also getting better.
 i know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting new york?
 every time i tell you that i love you, you flinch. but that's your problem.
 hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but i'm not in this for whooping cranes. i'm in it for cowgirls. if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. i want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
