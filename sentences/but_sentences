i went on motorola's website and followed all directions,###---###could not get it to pair again.
this is a simple little phone to use,###---###the breakage is unacceptible.
buy a different phone -###---###not this.
this item worked great,###---###it broke after 6 months of use.
its a little geeky###---###i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.
i've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks,###---###i really like it.
i know that sounds funny,###---###to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.well, this one works great.
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product###---###i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway.
i usually don't like headbands###---###this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i###---###i think it only worked once (thats when i first used it).
only had this a month###---###it's worked flawlessly so far.
not only will it drain your player,###---###may also potentially fry it.
i have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when i am home,###---###you cant not hear anything.
it was an inexpensive piece,###---###i would still have expected better quality.
the microphone also works well,###---###(according to people i have called) it applifies everything.
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week -###---###still lasts longer than thereplacement
i have used several phone in two years,###---###this one is the best.
i might have gotten a defect,###---###i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.
my colleague & i now get great reception.a little expensive,###---###performance is great.
perhaps my phone is defective,###---###people cannot hear me when i use this.
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it,###---###the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months###---###this one seems to be in for the long haul.
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on###---###later discarded because it scratched my ear.
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone,###---###i have the fire red and it's a great color!
they do not last forever,###---###is not overly expensive to replace.easy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried.
when i placed my treo into the case, not only was it not snug,###---###there was a lot of extra room on the sides.
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe,###---###it did not work.
the handsfree part works fine,###---###then the car tries to download the address book, and the treo reboots.overall, i still rate this device high.
looks good in the picture,###---###this case was a huge disappointment!!
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided,###---###it stays on pretty well.
the design might be ergonomic in theory###---###i could not stand having these in my ear.
can't store anything###---###phone numbers to sim.
cheap###---###hey it works.. was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one,###---###it has too many issues for me.the good
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better###---###these things made it impossible to wear.
i tried talking real loud###---###shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasn't great.
i have read other's reviews here###---###i haven't had any problem with it.
i have only had it for a few weeks,###---###so far, so good.
my phone sounded ok ( not great - ok),###---###my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.
this phone tries very hard to do everything###---###fails at it's very ability to be a phone.
yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving,###---###the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic,###---###it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  
the performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well,###---###whether the line itself is any good.  
it crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy -###---###honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  
i especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, i could predict the dialog verbatim,###---###the writing in this movie made better selections.  
if you want a movie that's not gross###---###gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  
i love lane,###---###i've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  
this is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything###---###the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  
crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion,###---###teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  
garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work,###---###netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak###---###the director gave them no action.  
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film,###---###a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry,###---###delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  
one more thing: i can tolerate political incorrectness very well, i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief,###---###the slavic female character was just too much.  
it features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic###---###lovable nuts.  
started watching this###---###didn't believe in any of the characters.  
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie,###---###we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth,###---###it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation,###---###it was just stupid.  
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute###---###if anyone has a question about fort steele, just ask away:)  
i think it was robert ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone###---###was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  
not too screamy not to masculine###---###just right.  
the use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie###---###is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  
i hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which i really like the star -###---###this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director###---###i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  
it came free with a dvd player i bought###---###i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell.  
i won't say any more - i don't like spoilers, so i don't want to be one,###---###i believe this film is worth your time.  
i wasn't expecting oscar material,###---###this?  
this is one i did not have,###---###i watched it recently on fox movie channel, and was very disappointed.  
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts,###---###the acting was as bad as the script.  
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was,###---###not scared at all.  
hackneyed writing, certainly,###---###made even worse by the bad directing.  
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down,###---###in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith,###---###my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  
this movie was kind of long in length,###---###i enjoyed every minute of it.  
totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see,###---###those who do will remember it.  
20th century fox's road house 1948) is not only quite a silly noir###---###is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  
while you don't yet hear mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now###---###which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  
both films are terrible,###---###to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy,###---###that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  
this was reflected not only in the cast,###---###also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  
the memories are murky###---###i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  
in conclusion, i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing###---###nonsense.  
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci,###---###the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him,###---###george was well dull.  
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function,###---###it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl,###---###deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  
im big fan of rpg games too,###---###this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting rpger there is.  
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin,###---###he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence,###---###rather, is about who presents better in court.  
predictable,###---###not a bad watch.  
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy,###---###that only enhanced the film.  
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie -###---###you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief###---###memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist doctor quinn.  
call me a nut,###---###i think this is one of the best movies ever.  
i won't spoil it,###---###the ending in pretty amazing.  
the best scene in the movie is at the end,###---###i won't spoil it.  
at around 4 pm i bought it, at around 8pm i started to watch, at around 8.15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain...###---###there wasn't.  
i'm so sorry###---###i really can't recommend it to anyone.  
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2###---###not quite that bad.  
the movie is not completely perfect###---###'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  
the ripped banana was not only ripped,###---###petrified and tasteless.
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers,###---###my husband and i were so disappointed with this place.
i do love sushi,###---###i found kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
the building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy,###---###i wouldn't eat here again.
maybe it's just their vegetarian fare,###---###i've been twice and i thought it was average at best.
i don't know what the big deal is about this place,###---###i won't be back "ya'all".

 forgive me father, for i have sinned. it has been two days since my last confession. father, my sin is a terrible sin. a sin of omission. there was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place,###---###my sin i think was graver stil.
 yo, check it.  this is good and all that###---###one day soon i want to have much benjamins so i can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. you hear me.
 i know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  through the roof. ###---###in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  i introduce you to myrna goldfarb. she's the best media consultant in the biz.

 as soon as i saw you loved me, i was pleased, and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, i would never love you. ###---###after our first kiss, i found that i had no power over myself.  i did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
 a man may need to do that, and find it amusing;###---###a girl is bound by other laws.
 monster!  your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop. ###---###i'll have my revenge, i will!  roddy, will you see me insulted?
 i accept,###---###i insist on a wager. the loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
 well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? no man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure,###---###a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  for instance, i have got the gout; who tends me?  a hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  my wife never comes near me.  what friend have i?  none in the wide world.  men of the world, as you and i are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
 west was one thing,###---###this --
 one went off, yeah,###---###it didn't touch him -- i thought you knew this --
 right in front of us. mueller went after him###---###we held him back.
 from dunbar? i hate to break this to you,###---###i don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
 look, all we've got is what kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except nunez. he found west, he saw mueller and pike,###---###just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
 someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. maybe nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow mueller,###---###the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their sergeant's killers! we'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
 i just saw the woman i'm going to marry, i know it.###---###then i lost her.
 only on the surface.###---###that's all i've ever seen.
 laz. i'm gonna put my trust in you. i'm gonna do it knowin' all too well i can get hurt like this. and i have been hurt. just like you.  woman like me, i got a lot of livin' to do.###---###my days are precious to me. they all i got left. don't want no more fuss. i want love in my life. you understanding me, laz?
 it got some miles on it,###---###my boys say she run good. got fresh 22's on her. ain't my doin'. that's just how it came to me. don't worry. nobody gonna come lookin' for it. i got the pinks... got no problem.  ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
 now see? don't do that. i'll go along with all you say about me.###---###that... you can't pretend no more on that. cuz i was just a kid, momma.  i didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  and you let him do it. some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only somebody you had.
 be better if i could talk to him in person. ###---###he's not an easy man to get to.
 okay,###---###don't kill him.  save a little for everybody.  a masterpiece.
 there wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure. ###---###bio- chemical data and morphology records of the nexus-6 were reported missing.  going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send holden in to run voight-kampff tests on the new employees.  guess he found himself one.
 yes it is. a girlfriend maybe.###---###a wife? i mean...
 it never works out because i'm into legs and butts and hair myself! that's why! so i wind up with guys who are very good looking,###---###even more shallow than i am, if you can picture that. now, if you'll excuse me, i have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
 i don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies,###---###if you can't get home by nightfall, i want you to look for something called a holiday inn. write that down. it's a hotel. there might still be one standing.
 i looked for you in my closet tonight.  it's crazy, i don't know where you came from,###---###i like you.
 go then. i can't let you put it in me now###---###i want you. i like you.
 i mean, some guys play anyway###---###they usually get slaughtered.
 yeah,###---###i don't think it's going to do much good. let's go. i'll try to talk to him later.
 he probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more,###---###he had to know you weren't walking out of there. figure it out. shooter's dead on the scene. no in-depth investigation. it'd slide right off his back. 'cause as much as i love ya, you're not exactly don corleone. what would he be losing? a thirty- five year old delivery boy?
 yeah. and uh, he's pissed off. he says, "why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? and he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes###---###he's gonna give all the black guys...
 yeah,###---###don't tell anybody.
 -- it's always bad and it's never anything###---###bits and pieces anyway!  you ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? you don't wonder that?
 i am the one who is rotting.###---###i think your face looks graver than mine.
 i'm no coward! i want what you want!###---###we need the nobles.
 now your father may seem sleepy to you,###---###that's just because of his medicine, okay?
 hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this,###---###do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
 maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,###---###soon, and for the rest of your life.
 last night i saw what has happened to you. the rick i knew in paris, i could tell him. he'd understand.###---###the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, i'll be leaving casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris. if we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not casablanca, not last night.
 how nice. you remembered.###---###of course, that was the day the germans marched into paris.
 i meant to,###---###something always held me up. i love you very much, ilsa.
 well, mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if i were a woman and i...  were not around, i should be in love with rick.###---###what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
 thank you. i hope you'll forgive me, captain,###---###the present french administration has not always been so cordial. may i present miss ilsa lund?
 my letter of transit? i could use a trip.###---###it doesn't make any difference about our bet. you still owe me ten thousand francs.
 there's still something about this business i don't quite understand. miss lund, she's very beautiful, yes,###---###you were never interested in any woman.
 well, i told strasser he wouldn't find the letters here.###---###i told my men to be especially destructive. you know how that impresses germans?  rick, have you got these letters of transit?
 oh, laugh if you will,###---###i happen to be familiar with your record. let me point out just two items. in 1935 you ran guns to ethiopia. in 1936, you fought in spain on the loyalist side.
 okay look, i know you're tired, i know you're thirsty,###---###give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
 *no*! i don't want to know him! he's doing *missionary* work--in *india*! i wrote him *weeks* ago,###---###he's either too holy or too busy to answer. maybe he got killed in the war!
 you laugh now,###---###wait until you need a clean place to powder. this is new york city, sister. public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. you know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? let's do the list... hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
 i don't know what you're into with the king pin,###---###whatever it is we get a piece, understand? we get a big piece. if we find out you're keeping us out, i may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to moonan myself. say something stupid if we got a deal, jake.
 no, the corporate papers have to be legit.###---###you gotta score an i.d. a clean one. talk to suits. i gotta get us a banker.
 just an idea,###---###let's just fucking split. we'll meet up anywhere. akron or austin or atlanta. anywhere...
 well it is.###---###i know where i am.
 so it's mr clean. wise up, jack, this whole business is bent. the casino is nothing###---###legal theft. and that's ok. it's the system. half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. we earn our money.  i'm on your side, jack. i don't need an enemy.
 we tried.###---###there wasn't enough business. the punters like company.
 pretty much the same reasons i was crying. ###---###things will be better when we move to a new place.
 and i feel real bad about all that###---###it doesn't mean i need to get involved.
 that's deep. ###---###before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
 he says he got it from a woman.  doesn't remember her name###---###she fits the description you gave like a glove.
 right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, amanda,###---###there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
 sure, i have.###---###not one with ice in it, that's all.
 just one, father,###---###boy was it a doozy.
 rose, i'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and i respect you as a woman.###---###after witnessing your son's behaviour today, i have... significant doubts...  our paths through life must be righteous. i urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
 suppose a pretty dame into my castle came - and let us say that i was going strong.  she might be stuck on me,###---###what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
 you was insulted,###---###you don't know it.
 no,###---###my dog he's a got millions of them --
 carry out this tragic folly if you will --###---###i for one will not be a part of it.  i will stay here in freedonia.
 you'll know presently. at the meeting of the society.###---###until then, i beg of you fox, keep it to yourself.
 i'm sorry i could only get you a third class ticket,###---###it's all we had.
 i'm sure that if mr. merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. now i'm not expecting miracles. i'm not saying he'll be able to read or write,###---###i do think that i can get him to speak for himself. i'm going to arrange things with carr gomm right now.  that was very good, john, very good. that's all for today. we shall do some more tomorrow. mothershead?
 exactly. exactly! that's exactly my feeling about it. it's hard to know. like, okay,###---###how many times do i think something and it doesn't happen? that's what you're saying, right? you forget about those times. right?
 my embarrassing admission is i really like that you're nice. right now, anyway. i can't tell from one moment to the next what i'm going to like.###---###right now i'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. that was nice of you.
 it's okay if i sit closer? so i don't have to scream. not that i don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. ###---###i don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
